" Billy Wilder's 1960 classic reminds us of the true spirit of Christmas – togetherness, and hope for the future  is the perfect Christmas film. Not Christmas as we'd like it to be – roaring fires, jingle bells, snow – but Christmas as it is in reality. Sometimes joyful, sometimes mundane, sometimes lonely. The holiday season has always offered introspection: we hope for a moment of thankfulness, but life in its strange cruelty can, for some, feel like the knife is only being dug deeper, as hard as we may try to stifle the prospect.  But even in the bleakest of Christmases, there's always hope. It thrives on it. And it's precisely hope that Billy Wilder's beloved 1960 film offers the world. A turning point even for its director, in his own way, after years of fixating on high-flung stories drenched in Hollywood glamour and the affairs of writers, detectives, playboys and pilots; all delivered with a healthy dose of cynicism, too, peaking with 1951's bleak . But all that changed with , a film that deals with love. Real love. A kind quiet, pained, but with eyes fixed on the stars above.  CC Baxter (Jack Lemmon) and Fran Kubelik (Shirley MacLaine) are beaten down by the world. Their souls are mush. He's a bottom-rung office worker trapped in the most uneasy of agreements: loan his apartment out to his womanising superiors so they can continue their affairs in comfort and secrecy, and he can hope to find himself with that coveted promotion. She's an elevator girl who happens to be an unlucky participant in one of those affairs, desperately in love with boss Jeff D Sheldrake (Fred MacMurray). He promises he'll leave his wife; she's too smart to fall for his lies, too foolish to leave him altogether.  As Kubelik puts it, “Some people take, some people get took. And they know they're getting took and there's nothing they can do about it.” It's a cycle they're trapped in merely because they never lacked the empathy needed to be a taker, to exploit weakness, but had only a heart so ready to give. Just the kind of attitude that gets you left out in the rain, bitter as that revelation may be.  For Baxter, the sensation is literal: he's left to wander the freezing streets while his apartment is used for illicit thrills. Kubelik is abandoned by her lover when he must speed home to trim the Christmas tree with his family. As holiday preparations bubble away in the heart of New York City, it's like they're peering in through the frosted glass to glimpse at the warmth inside. During the holidays, those feelings of isolation take on a stark vibrancy. It's overwhelming for Kubelik. Alone in the strange, alienating environment of Baxter's apartment (she doesn't know it's Baxter's apartment at the time), she grabs a bottle of pills and attempts to end her life. His isolation, meanwhile, is fuelled by the discovery that Kubelik, the woman he's become so infatuated with, is the mistress Sheldrake so belittingly speaks of. He tries to find brief relief in another lonely soul, bringing home a woman who can't bear to return to her empty apartment, her husband locked in jail.   is a comedy that fully, and so empathetically, deals with suicide. At its darkest centre, the cha-cha tones of the record player cut to silence as the doctor tries to revive an unconscious Kubelik, slapping her over and over again as Baxter flinches with every hit. All watched over by Baxter's drooping Christmas tree, draped in a few pieces of stringy tinsel – quite the desolate picture. Baxter phones Sheldrake to tell him what happened. He answers in his silk robe, a lavish suburban Christmas glimmering behind him. He wants nothing to do with it.  
The key to s magic, however, is that it can both acknowledge how bitter the touch of loneliness can really feel, especially at a time of year so riotously focused on the idea of thankfulness, while also offering hope. Great hope. A true belief that every lost soul has a life preserver somewhere out there, waiting. In Kubelik's recovery, both come to understand that their worth can be unlocked in each other. That they can piece each other back together like a shattered vase lovingly reconstructed. Baxter confesses he also tried to end his life once. It comes out in such an offhand way, as if he was shedding off a coat of the past. We can populate our streets with ringing bells and bustling shoppers but, at the end of the day, Christmas lives in its quietest moments. In togetherness, wherever we may find it. Family and friends, perhaps, but if those things are far out of reach, even in strangers. “Ya know, I used to live like Robinson Crusoe,” Baxter says. “I mean, shipwrecked among eight million people. And then one day I saw a footprint in the sand and there you are.” No one is too broken. And no one is too lost not to be found.  We use cookies to enhance your visit to our site and to bring you advertisements that might interest you. Read our   and   Policies to find out more.

" The film director saved his latest film after its star, Spacey, was accused of sexual assault The impression one gets chatting to director Ridley Scott is that he’s a man who is not lacking in confidence or self-belief. Perhaps that is what comes from being a director with so many classics under your belt:  ,  ,  , and  . It’s also a personality trait that enabled him to act decisively and quickly when his latest film, the J Paul  biopic,  , found itself embroiled in the sexual allegations made against its star Kevin Spacey.   Spacey had been touted as an awards contender playing the billionaire who refused to pay Italian kidnappers a random fee for his 16-year-old grandson in 1973. Then came the allegation made by actor Anthony Rapp that Spacey had made untoward sexual advances towards him at a party when he was just 14 years old. This accusation opened the floodgates and soon a number of sexual misconduct allegations were made against the former Old Vic artistic director and both Netflix, who were in the midst of shooting the sixth season of  and Scott decided that they needed to jettison the actor from their projects.  was pulled from the prestigious AFI Fest in a move seen as a precursor to the movie being withdrawn, or postponed from cinemas, but Scott had other ideas. The British director was adamant that he didn’t want the release date of his film moved. He knew that Danny Boyle had been shooting , an eight-part television series on the kidnapping that is at the centre of   and with that series due to air in the spring he made the decision to quickly order reshoots with Christopher Plummer replacing Spacey in the  role.  “I’m fast and I thought that I have to do something right now,” says Scott. “So already at that moment, I was discussing with my partner who had paid for the film, [billionaire] Dan Friedkin, if I can get Christopher Plummer, we can be off and running and I’ll be shooting it in nine days.”  Friedkin stumped up $10m to fund the reshoots. If it had not been such a major story it would be impossible to know that Plummer hadn’t been involved all along. Scott says that when Spacey was in the role it was a much colder version of , but now, “Christopher is both sympathetic and cruel sometimes”.  The choice of Plummer came easily as he was being considered when Spacey was originally cast. “It was a toss up between the two,” says Scott. The advantage of Plummer was that he is an octogenarian as is the character depicted in the film, but it made business sense at the time to give Spacey prosthetics and age him up. “Kevin had a big profile with the success of   and he was useful on a commercial level.”  It says much about the casting process of Hollywood and the value of “celebrity” that the final choice was not down to who was most right for the role, but who would put bums on seats. As soon as the audience turned, so did Scott. It’s a move that is as ruthless as Commodus, the emperor portrayed in  .  What’s good for business has always been a motivating factor for Scott. He was born in November 1937 in South Shields, County Durham. His father was in the Royal Engineers and largely absent from most of his early life with the Second World War raging. Scott’s earliest memories are of hiding under the staircase as the Germans attacked and of a barrage balloon used to defend against aircraft attack bursting and covering his house that made him confuse day for night.  It’s his housewife mother that he praises for bringing up three boys. His elder brother Frank was a sailor, whilst his now deceased younger brother Tony was also an esteemed movie director who made  . “My mum she should have been a business woman,” he says when talking about her zest for life.  He struggled at school before going to West Hartlepool Art College where he finally felt at home. He then went to the Royal College of Art in London, which he calls a life-changing experience that led to a spell at the BBC and then a successful career in advertising. From the age of 30 he wanted to make a movie, but the opportunity never arose. He was 40 when he made  about warring Napoleonic officers that won a prize at Cannes for Best First Film in 1977. It was watching   that pushed him to making sci-fi films set in space.   pushed his own career to intergalactic proportions and given his admiration for his mother it’s perhaps unsurprising that he saw Ripley as a heroine rather than hero. He would go on to make   which decades after it was made remains the great female buddy movie.  “A lot of my films don’t tend to age,” he says showing that brash self-confidence again. “They stand up. I’m very aware of that and I’m very competitive. These films are always still playing and so are often in need of technical rejuvenation and so I’ve just done r again for the sixth time as it’s going out again in 4K.”  is an unusual project for Scott because he didn’t originate the project himself. The script landed on his desk and he was attracted to it because, “I thought it was very valid because of what is going on today with super wealth and the way the world is going.”  He thinks people have got too wealthy, but then also asks, “What is wealthy? When you hear people say that they are giving away 10 billion but they are worth 200 billion, it’s lunch money.”  He’s not sure taxation is the answer as many billionaires are entrepreneurs who create wealth and pay taxes. “What is the balance of payments?” he wonders. It’s a question that he ponders in his new film where Plummer’s  is treating the kidnapping as a business transaction, waiting to see who will drop their guard first. In the end it’s hard to tell what is right and what is the wrong way to do things.  He will be returning to his youth as he plans to make a Battle of Britain film, “There is a lot of competition with films that have come out, such as  , but that won’t stop us. It’s difficult because you’re into all kinds of real flying and digital flying and now you can get it almost perfect, but the most important thing is the characters, I always invest in characters.”  And at 80, Scott remains one of the great characters of British film.  We use cookies to enhance your visit to our site and to bring you advertisements that might interest you.

" The Independent ​sat down with the ‘Thor: Ragnarok’ actor to discuss Taika Waititi, Marvel and the delights of a personal and professional renaissance at 65 “Wow, you’re tall.”  , standing 6ft 4in, greets me (6ft 3in) at the door of a London hotel room. “Are your family just as tall?” he asks. I tell him my two brothers are both taller, standing 6ft 5in. “Taller than you! That’s incredible. What do they do?”  One was in a band, the other studies animation. “Amazing. Your parents must be very proud. Did you know I’m in a jazz band?”  I did.  “If you come to Los Angeles, will you come and see us? At Rockwell – just remember ‘Sam Rockwell.’  I’ll give you a doctor’s note, telling them you need to get the West Coast air.” How can I say no?  “Make sure to find me, will you?” So starts my interview with Jeff Goldblum. Actors don’t often ask questions at junkets, preferring to move swiftly onto being questioned. But that’s not Jeff Goldblum. Instead, the 65-year-old keeps them coming, asking about everything from family to my acting abilities. Cynics may say that he’s diverting attention away from himself and merely being charming for a positive write-up. To me, Goldblum just seems downright charming – perhaps I’ve been duped? Perched forward on a white chair and wearing a denim jacket/turtleneck combo, Goldblum’s promoting  , the most recent Marvel blockbuster to reach cinemas. Directed by Taika Waititi, the wildly fun picture sees Goldblum play the devilishly hilarious Grandmaster, the tyrannical ruler of the planet Sakaar and an all-out pleasure seeker. The role seems very Jeff Goldblum. “I don’t know how much was me,” the actor says. “But, Taika Waititi, he’s an improviser. He said ‘If you want to, I have a notion that we’ll improvise a lot. And it’ll be a character who will make use of several of the things you do. It won’t be comic-book-y. Your character is theatrical’.”  Sure enough, when they were on set in Australia, Goldblum was able to improvise, often offering 10 completely differing takes on a single scene. “I would go, ‘why don’t I say this?’ Taika would say, ‘dance like I am’. Then I would [Goldblum starts dancing in his chair] until we got kicked off set. We fooled around a lot. I was very anxious to see which version made the final cut. I liked what they used. They took out the bad stuff and made me look OK. Then at the end... did you stay until the end credits?” I did, the scene’s great. “That was a kind of improvised thing we did.” Of course, Goldblum has worked on many big-budget pictures before, including  and both their respective sequels. For  , everything seems to have been a little looser, the final project having – at times – more in common with an indie movie than $180m blockbuster.  “You can’t imagine the team it takes to make these big epic productions,” he says. “And add the element of having someone like Taika coming along. It’s this free actor workshop. They build in extra time to redo some scenes if need be. On some other things, [Goldblum puts on a stern voice] ‘this is your moment and we have to do it now’. It’s a little more burdensome here and there. Although, I’ve been quite lucky to work with Mr Spielberg and Jack Bellicec. They know how to loosen things up, so it’s big and it’s free.” Being on the set of   certainly sounds like a lot of fun, I say. “Do you act?” Goldblum asks. I don’t. The closest I’ve been is directing a small production at school, donkey’s years ago. “For the stage?” A stage version of  . “Like a stage version of the movie?” Exactly that. It wasn’t very good. Goldblum starts singing: “La di dah di da, here’s my audition for you, so I can be in your next production. I think we’d make a good teeeeeeeeam.” Goldblum certainly doesn’t need any more work at the moment. Last year, he reprised his role from   for the sequel  . Next year, the actor will once again play Dr Ian Malcolm, this time alongside Chris Pratt in  . Later that same year, Goldblum will voice a canine in Wes Anderson’s   (“Just   he’s a brilliant artist,” he says of the director). The question, then, is why are we having a Goldblumaissance now? “It’s just about pestering people,” jokes Goldblum. “Don’t worry everyone, it’ll be over soon enough!” The tone shifts to one that’s slightly more serious. “There’s coming and going, and that includes me. But, I’m sitting up and taking nourishment at this point with much delight. I don’t know why I’m so lucky. I’m more grateful, predominantly, than any other colour I can think of. I’m lucky that I’ve stayed continually active. That’s a pretty good trick in itself.” Goldblum studied acting under Sandy Meisner, whose pupils include Steve McQueen, Naomi Watts, Sandra Bullock, and another Jeff (Bridges). Meisner told Goldblum something very early on that stuck with the actor throughout his life: ‘It takes 20 years to even call yourself an actor, and then a lifetime to keep getting better’. “Maybe that has something to do with it,” Goldblum continues. “I do aim to... to have a chance to get better. I’m on the threshold of doing something better. I’m enjoying acting, certainly enjoying it more than ever. Maybe babies are lucky. That’s what my wife says. We had one a couple of years ago, then one six months ago.” Married twice before, Goldblum never had children before wedding Canadian Olympic gymnast Emilie Livingston. Their first son, Charlie Ocean, was born mid-2015, a year before   reached cinemas. The pair then had another boy, River Joe, in April earlier this year. “I feel full of vim, vigour, and vitamin A… if that’s the right vitamin,” he says.  One thing I wonder, after becoming a father and having been an actor for well over 20 years, is whether Goldblum still sees himself as a movie star? “I wouldn’t say I am a movie star,” he answers. “But, I’ll tell you what, it gives me a real thrill when…” He pauses. “I flew here yesterday, and that card you fill out on the aeroplane. I’ll be darned when they ask ‘what’s your first name? Last name? Given name? Where were you born? What’s your profession?’ I still get a thrill out of just writing ‘actor’… Isn’t that crazy?”  12 February

  Goldblum shares a quick story about wanting nothing more than to be an actor since being 10 years old. “I just wanted to do it the best way,” he says. “My father was a doctor. Everyone I knew in Pittsburgh was similar. I was embarrassed to tell anybody until I left for New York. Nobody knew it, because, you know, it was this romantic idea.” Now that he’s achieved that dream, does he feel fulfilled? “Fulfilment means you bring an ability to be satisfied, to be fulfilled in any circumstance. You don’t wait for the outer confluence of circumstances to go, ‘oh, now your fulfilled, I’ve got the car I wanted, I’m on a date with the right girl’. The talent I aspire to is, no matter what cards present themselves, you’re able to find something that you’re able to call fulfilment.” A moment of reflection. “What do you think of that answer?” I quite like it. “You do?” Very much.  Perhaps then, one should ask which path Goldblum would have gone down if acting hadn’t worked out. “I like to play the piano, and having a weekly gig,” he says. A rock star or a movie star, I say. “I don’t know if I would have been a rock star. I like jazz. I taught acting for a couple of years. I like the classroom, by gum! I like the activity and the challenge of trying to transmit something, awaken that in someone else. That’s a fun and worthy thing. My sister teaches, she’s a painter, and she makes things all the time. That’s a great thing to do.” Someone working for Disney waves around frantically behind Goldblum, signalling that our interview has come to an end. As I begin to leave, I profess that   was one of my favourite movies growing up. The actor begins singing the film’s theme song. I ask if he would play a jazz version when I arrive in LA? He begins scatting along to the song. It’s all very Jeff Goldblum. We use cookies to enhance your visit to our site and to bring you advertisements that might interest you.

The actor completed her look with a dramatic pendant necklace while keeping her hair and makeup fairly simple, allowing the dress to take centre stage. Rex Features “It is one of many factors leading women to a safer place because of their status in the acting world. I am excited about the Time's UP movement because true change is long overdue.” After offering the statement, Blanco took to Twitter to defend the decision once more, saying: “The issue is bigger than my dress colour… Red is passionate.” The issue is bigger than my dress color  Red is passionate She also spoke to  about the incident, saying the backlash “hurts my feelings, but I guess it's part of being in our industry.” “We have people who appreciate you and others that don’t,” she added. The designer Atria Couture did an amazing job with my dress and I appreciate them for dressing me.

" 'Three Billboards' is the latest example in a series of recent films that have been on the receiving end of backlash because of their depictions of race Martin McDonagh’s  ,  arrives in UK cinemas on the back of an award-winning festival run and critical claim. It won the Best Screenplay prize at the Venice Film Festival and the coveted People’s Choice award in Toronto. It’s the most nominated film at the London Critics’ Circle awards and received a slew of nominations for this weekend’s Golden Globes. Nonetheless,   is already proving to be one of the most divisive films of the past year. While many have been calling it an “absolute marvel”, others, such as Zeba Blay in  , have claimed, “White Critics Love  like they Love Their Racist Uncles”. McDonagh must be rubbing his hands at the debate. In his earlier movies,  and  , and in his plays McDonagh has built a stellar reputation on creating harsh comedy full of put-downs and a disregard for the PC police. In   one of the many jokes about racism involves a racist cop, played by Sam Rockwell, assimilating the language or political correctness to undermine it. It’s ridiculous to say as Blay argues that the reaction of the audience is divided over race lines too. That kind of generalisation is as prejudiced as the criticism it is aimed at. Yet this film, which is funny, well acted and full of witty dialogue, is also deeply problematic because of Rockwell’s Dixon character becoming the anti-hero of the piece and the three black characters, a cop, a shop assistant and billboard painter, in the drama being underdeveloped. How you react to the film will depend on whether you can sympathise with Dixon as McDonagh wants us to do, in a development that echoes the transformation of Clint Eastwood in . Personally, I couldn’t get onside with this paradigm shift. Ebbings, Missouri, is a fictional town created by McDonagh. Some will see this decision as a metaphor for it being a social satire on present-day America, others that it’s a fictional town that could be anywhere in America that allows the director to take liberties with the characters, making them hyper-real in what is essentially a revenge thriller. Those who see the film as social satire on the state of the nation are likely to be perturbed by the poor racial dynamic; those who watch it as a revenge thriller, pure and simple, are likely to enjoy it. The film stars Frances McDormand as Mildred, a role that seems to want to remind us of her great turn in the Coen Brothers’  . Mildred puts adverts on three billboards in a campaign to encourage the local police force to be more proactive in finding the man that raped and murdered her daughter. She names Chief Willoughby on the final billboard, who it turns out is an endearing, much admired and compassionate police officer played by Woody Harrelson. On his force, the cops are racist, celebrated for dishing out beatings and generally above the law. As the investigation into the murders develops it’s Dixon who becomes the pivotal character. Yet for the most part this is because events force him into a corner rather than him making a conscious decision to develop, yet as he gets more screen time Dixon becomes more sympathetic both in his actions and in the gaze of the camera. But it’s a transformation that doesn’t work, not because of Dixon, but because it’s coupled with McDonagh not caring about the effects that racism has on his underdeveloped black characters, one of whom is thrown in jail for days on a trumped-up marijuana charge. Another black character is the new police chief, played by Clarke Peters, who puts Dixon in his place. Tonally it misfires. It seems odd in a film that spends so much time establishing that police in America can literally get away with anything because there is little consequence to their actions that a cartoon black figure would be able to create such change. The trouble with   is that it sets up a world that seems like it has a lot to say, but in the end is rather empty and is not interested in the racism or misogyny that it lays bare except as comedic entertainment. And some of the jokes are dubious at best. In the year after  won the Best Picture Oscar and  astounded with its cutting social commentary,   is the latest example in a series of recent films that have been on the receiving end of backlash because of their depictions, or lack thereof, of race. Some have been accused of whitewashing history (  and  ) or lambasted for telling an African American story through the eyes of a white character ( ). Throw   into the mix and what is worrying is that the films being made by white directors, albeit with good intentions, are those that are not standing up to scrutiny. Although in the past the same could be said for a good number of Wayan Brothers and Tyler Perry movies. Sofia Coppola won Best Director at the Cannes film festival for an adaptation of Thomas Cullinan’s book in which she decided to drop the black female slave, arguing, “It was not the depiction of an African American character that I wanted to show them.” Coppola failed to consider that her “good intentions” were now in fact part of a greater problem of whitewashing history that seems endemic in cinema, nor that she is a white person telling us how black people should and shouldn’t be represented. For  , it was Nolan’s failure to put in any soldiers from the Commonwealth that came under fire, as well as some French critics arguing that their troops were not shown on screen. For a film on the scale of  , there are a lot of decision makers who deemed it not important to show that not every soldier on the beach was white or remember that it was called a world war because people of all colour, races and creeds were involved. Again there are counter-arguments that could be made about Nolan telling one story and his artistic choice would count for more, if we were not back on territory that had been discussed when   did the same thing. Kathryn Bigelow’s   was a film that seemed to want to support the Black Lives Matter movement with its references to modern police brutality, but it came in for criticism for its failure to develop the black characters, especially with Will Poulter’s cop being the most memorable character in the film, a lot of this down to his excellent performance. The violent depiction of police brutality that left Ashley Clarke wondering in   whether “white supremacists might actually enjoy watching it”. We also had the Pepsi advert debacle in which Kendall Jenner stops a riot by handing a police officer a can of soda. The commercial belittled the sacrifices made in the Black Lives Matter and civil rights movement, yet in pulling the advert, the soda company also could plausible argue, “Pepsi was trying to project a global a message of unity, peace and understanding”. Right now it seems that nothing has been more apt in recent times than   being called as the Oscar Best Picture winner instead of  . On that stage that night were faces of confusion, good will and a desire to get to the right outcome. It just seems like there are going to be a lot of hiccups along the way, and films such as  are under more scrutiny than ever.

" From Gremlins to Black Christmas, it remains one of the more unusual traditions of the year Outside of merely capitalizing on the most overtly hyped period of the year, Christmas actually plays nicely into the very psychology of what makes great horror: the exploitation of all those insidious little fears which bury themselves deep inside of us.  For as much as that affixed smile may hold through bickering relatives, shopping crowds, and burnt turkeys; the holidays are precisely that time of year when we can be left on edge from pressing all that accumulated stress deep, deep inside our psyches. Which is exactly where horror lives.  Amplify your fears of a Christmas meltdown a little further; then a little further than that. Suddenly the idea of a psychotic elf with a chainsaw trying to break through your front door doesn’t seem so wild.  So, if you need to ease the tension hanging in the cinnamon-scented air this holiday season, why not release it all with one of these gruesome holiday horrors? 
Our fondness for sweet, little Gizmo aside; let’s never forget that   is a surprisingly sadistic piece of work. Gremlin-in-a-microwave, anyone? Director Joe Dante managed to spin a Spielberg-produced Christmas movie into pure anarchy; taking on the grossest aspects of materialism with its all-consuming beasties. And when exactly are we any more materialistic than at the holidays?  
Bob Clark’s 1974 horror gives a holiday twist on a classic urban legend. A sorority house set affright over the Christmas period by a series of creepy anonymous phones calls leading to creepier full-on murders; this flick was a key source of influence for the slasher movie craze of the 80s, predating even John Carpenter’s landmark   by a whole four years. 
Not much of a horror, per say; yet it’s hard to omit the Tim Burton crafted, delightfully ghoulish holiday mash-up from a list of this nature. As Halloween Town’s celebrated Pumpkin King stumbles across all the pleasures of Christmas Town, we’re treated to each of his obsessive attempts to recreate the festivities in his own world.  From the invention of Sandy Claws to vicious toy ducks chasing children around their living rooms,   continues Burton’s own morbid fascination with the season, following on from the likes of   and  .  The director’s association between the ghastly and cheerful seems to date back all the way to his childhood,  , “Anytime there was Christmas or Halloween, you'd go to Thrifty's and buy stuff and it was great. It gave you some sort of texture all of a sudden that wasn't there before. 
Parents, do not get this confused with the Michael Keaton schmaltz-fest of the same name. That’s unless you’ve been aching to have some very traumatised children on your hands. Michael Cooney’s preposterous, schlock horror turns your precious, magical snowman into a homicidal maniac; when a truck carrying an imprisoned killer crashes into a genetic research vehicle and fuses its passenger with the surrounding snow.  Your presumptions are correct;   is uproariously awful, a series of brutal killings dotted with even more brutal puns. And a perfect example of horror’s love of taking all things pure and innocent and turning those very things against us. Corncob pipes and button noses included.   
The Finnish-produced   expands its 2003 and 2005 shorts to a feature-length reimagining of Kris Kringle as the ancient demon with a taste for flesh who’s discovered after scientists open up the world’s largest burial mound. Unleashed onto the wintry landscape, he’s brought local children to feed on by his army of elves luring the innocent into traps.   off-the-wall concept works because it takes full advantage of that pitch black, yet wonderfully dry sense of Nordic humour. It’s not desperate to hammer home those punch lines but finds its glee setting out its own twisted game around those sacred concepts of Christmas magic. You’ll never leave milk and cookies out again… 
OK, so this tale of a Santa-suited killer really isn’t that notable, but it does feature this iconic piece of bad acting. No one has ever screamed, “GARBAGE DAY” like this kid screams, “GARBAGE DAY”.  We use cookies to enhance your visit to our site and to bring you advertisements that might interest you.

" Williams is the moral centre of the film, the one character who doesn’t allow the dollar bills and pounds signs to cloud her vision  “Money is never just money; it always stands for something,” we are told midway through Ridley Scott’s absorbing new film about the kidnapping of the teenaged John Paul  III in Italy in 1973.  is billed as a crime drama but its real themes are exchange and negotiation. The questions it asks are what lengths its characters will go to in order to acquire or hold onto money – and whether money is a source of life or death. Ridley Scott has shown the same ruthlessness and brinkmanship you would expect from the kidnap victim’s oil tycoon grandfather, J Paul , in rescuing his own movie. With Kevin Spacey (originally cast as J Paul ) in disgrace over sexual harassment allegations, Scott drafted in Christopher Plummer to replace him. He then re-shot and re-edited large parts of the film only weeks before its planned release. Plummer is very impressive indeed but, with all the fuss around his last-minute casting, it is easy to forget that Michelle Williams is the at the heart of the film. She plays Gail Harris, the distraught mother trying to get her son back from the kidnappers. She is a grim and morbid story’s one truly admirable character. Williams shows us Gail’s helplessness and terror but also her steeliness and courage as she fights to get her son back. Hers is the performance that we should really be talking about. After her vapid showing as PT Barnum’s wife in , it’s heartening to see her back in the limelight. Throughout the film, Scott juggles styles. Early on, when John Paul  III (Charlie Plummer) is seen walking through the streets of Rome just prior to his kidnapping, it is as if we’ve stumbled into some Fellini or Pasolini film of the period. The city has a carnivalesque, feel. The good-looking youngster makes small talk with kind-hearted prostitutes. Scott accentuates the glamour of the Rome scenes in order to contrast them with the squalor that follows once the boy is bundled away by the kidnappers and driven hundreds of miles to captivity in a remote part of Calabria. As a story,  is pulling in several different directions at once. It’s a satirical study of how extreme wealth distorts human behaviour. Some of its best scenes are its most absurd ones, in which Plummer’s J Paul  behaves with a grotesque meanness.  12 February

He’s not just the richest man in the world; he is the richest man in the history of the world and, yet, in his own mind, he is financially vulnerable. As he pops a champagne cork, he sternly tells his security boss, ex-CIA agent Fletcher Chase (Mark Wahlberg), that he has “no money to spare”.  has 14 grandchildren. He reasons that if he starts paying ransoms now, he will have “14 kidnapped grandchildren”. Besides, ransom money isn’t tax deductible. There are darkly comic scenes in which we will hear church music on the soundtrack as money is being counted or in which we will see  entering into complex negotiations – not to help Gail and her kidnapped son but to buy some precious painting of a Madonna and child that he has long coveted. At the same time, this is a thriller. The clock is running. Fletcher Chase is sent by  to Rome to help Gail get her son back. The filmmakers dutifully try to ratchet up the tension. Every so often, Gail receives a call from Cinquanta (Romain Duris), the kidnapper’s representative, warning her that if the cash isn’t forthcoming, John Paul will be mutilated and killed. In the course of their rushed calls, Gail and Cinquanta form an unlikely bond. They’re both equally frustrated that the ransom isn’t being paid. Gail protests in vain that she is “not a real ” and that she doesn’t have access to her father-in-law’s wealth. Cinquanta is astounded and frustrated that the  family is doing so little to get John Paul back. The Italian police aren’t doing much to help and the Italian media is doing nothing but get in the way. All the while, John Paul is kept locked up as if he is a piece of livestock. The southern Italy scenes are reminiscent of old mafia movies.  Scott relishes the contrast between rural Calabria and the chilly Home Counties splendour in which J Paul  is living in his mausoleum-like mansion house, Sutton Place.  One grisly detail everyone remembers from the  kidnapping is that John Paul’s ear was cut off and sent in the mail by his captors. Inevitably, the incident of ear is foregrounded. The film’s poster is a grotesque image of a severed, bleeding ear, moulded out of a $100 bill, and the scene of the severance is shot in predictably stomach-churning fashion. Even so, the thriller elements are the least convincing element here. Wahlberg’s character is clearly intended as an equivalent to the type of special agent Clint Eastwood played in Eighties and Nineties movies but there is little space for movie heroism here. Nor, in spite of the character’s rapport with Gail, is there the chance to develop a romantic sub-plot. The film, based on John Pearson’s book about the  clan, generally sticks close to the facts. For all the vigour of the action scenes – a fire deliberately started in the fields in Calabria, a night-time chase around the maze-like streets of a Calabrian town – this is a character drama, not a conventional crime movie. Plummer brings cunning, venality and, finally, an unlikely pathos to his role as , the wealthy old potentate who learns the age-old lesson that all the money in the world can’t bring security or peace of mind. Williams, meanwhile, is the moral centre of the film, the one character who doesn’t allow the dollar bills and pound signs to cloud her vision. hits UK cinemas on 5 January.

" Glenn Gould - The Goldberg Variations: Complete Unreleased Recording Sessions June 1955, The Fall - The Singles 1978-2016, Wilson Pickett - The Complete Atlantic Albums Collection, Various Artists - To The Outside Of Everything, Elton John - Diamonds ★★★★☆ The growth of social media has revolutionised the way that pop stars connect with fans, offering both a precisely-targeted promotional tool delivering information about forthcoming products and appearances, and algorithmic analysis of their fanbase’s desires. Before the internet exerted its grip, this sort of putative star/fan interfacing was undertaken by the fan club, via mail-shot newsletters. And as with most things, The Beatles were way ahead of the game in this respect, starting in 1963 a tradition of sending a free seasonal flexi-disc of unique material to every fan club member, collected together here for the first time as a box of vinyl singles. Initially, they were simple scripts of hokey messages written by publicist Tony Barrow, transformed into something more personal through mis-readings (“We hope you enjoy the records as much as we enjoy melting them”), mickey-taking and bogus laughter, whilst amusingly re-written Christmas carols like “Jingle Bells” are bashed out on piano, kazoo and harmonica. By 1965, they had got more into the swing of things. Recorded following the Rubber Soul sessions, the routine messages and accounts of their activities are adrift amongst a tide of impromptu nonsense – bogus Scottish folk-songs, “Yesterday” in pub singalong style, with Christmas lyric, etc – and an apparently sincere apology, “Please everybody, if we haven’t done what we could have done, we tried”. In 1966, they tried even harder: helmed by McCartney, and titled Pantomime, it involved a series of nonsensical tableaux such as the fairytale “Podgy The Bear And Jasper” and bogus Corsican chorale “Orowayna”, book-ended by “Everywhere It’s Christmas”. The following year’s seasonal song, “Christmas Time (Is Here Again)”, was subsequently used as the B-side of “Free As A Bird”, although the welter of nonsense originally surrounding it – tap-dancing audition, spoof political interview, game-show parody, request for “Plenty Of Jam-Jars” by The Ravellers – prefigures the more involved montages created by Kenny Everett for the 1968 and 1969 Christmas Records. The former is the best, a whip-smart assemblage of edits and effects incorporating atonal piano tinklings, a sped-up bit of “Helter Skelter”, McCartney’s all-purpose year-round greetings song, a snatch of Perrey & Kingsley’s bouncing electronica, typical nonsense verbiage from Lennon (“This film is about an hourglass pleasure-boat”), and a guest slot of Tiny Tim warbling tremulously through “Nowhere Man”. By 1969, the band had broken up, which made Everett’s job harder, and rendered the already sardonic goodwill messages even less sincere. John and Yoko shouldered most of the duties, recounting the activities of “Jock and Yono”; but the best moment is Everett’s treatment of Ringo’s attempt to get in a plug for his forthcoming movie appearance, with a sped-up transition of “Merry Christmas” into “Magic Christian”. Having long been amongst the most sought-after Beatles ephemera, this set of the Christmas Records makes a welcome addition to the official catalogue; although sometimes as flimsy in content as they were physically, their whimsical flights of fancy and relentlessly frivolous tone provide refreshing reminders of an era when pop was less ruthlessly commercial and less achingly earnest. ★★★★☆ Following previous Fela Kuti assemblages by Questlove, Ginger Baker and Brian Eno, this fourth set of seven LPs was curated by Erykah Badu, ranging from 1976’s   to 1992’s  , the last album released in Fela’s lifetime. As with most of his work, the records feature just one or two long tracks, immersive Afrobeat grooves which, Badu believes, enable performer and listener to become “one living, breathing organism”. Save for 1977’s  , which prominently features Art Ensemble trumpeter Lester Bowie, the focus was always firmly on Fela, a dominating presence conducting his band through vamps of electric piano or sax, building up a majestic momentum of burring brass, while delivering pidgin tongue-lashings aimed at everything from skin-lightening (“Yellow Fever”) to the covert crushing of forces for change (“Underground System”). “Coffin For Head Of State” is the saddest and most affecting, a lament for his mother, who died from injuries sustained after being thrown from an upstairs window by government soldiers invading Fela’s Kalakuta Republic compound. ★★★★★ Glenn Gould is solely responsible for the current popularity of Bach’s  , which until his 1955 debut Columbia recording was an overlooked obscurity. As demonstrated by this exhaustive account, featuring every session across five CDs, the young Gould was a ferment of focused innovation from the start. He works assiduously through 21 takes of the opening “Aria” before dashing through the first take of “Variation 1” at an incredible blur of light-speed fingering that’s simply dazzling. He’s mindful of his eccentricities throughout, pondering whether he needs a higher chair, and enquiring whether any of his notorious “singing” spoiled a take. But he’s also keenly aware of the possibilities of the studio – by “Variation 5”, he’s asking for the first half of one take to be combined with the latter half of another, an early instance of the process that would characterise his subsequent recordings. Including vinyl and CD versions of the finished album, and a book of photos, essays and transcripts of studio discussions, this is a treasure trove for any Gould enthusiast. ★★★★☆ You’ll never find him on any celebrity red carpet, but Mark E Smith has always been an A-lister: specifically, a list that includes alcohol, amphetamines, asperity, antipathy and the avant-garde, stirred into a glorious blurt of often perplexing words and music probably best heard in the relatively approachable confines of this seven CD collection of The Fall’s singles. Smith’s lyrical interests range from comics to football, drugs to religion, Lancashire to sociopathy, while his musical inspirations are evident in the band’s cover versions: classic Britpop like “Victoria“ and “I Can Hear The Grass Grow”; melodramatic narratives like ”There’s A Ghost In My House“; and particularly, mutant rockabilly cuts like that most blatant of drug songs, ”Mr Pharmacist”. Distilled into original material, at their best The Fall produced triumphant outsider anthems like “Totally Wired” and “Cruiser’s Creek”, pop with a devilish, rockabilly rebel edge; though with ”Hit The North, Pt 1“, they effectively created the basic blueprint for the later groovy rumblings of Madchester. All human life, as the saying goes, is here. ★★★★☆ Wilson Pickett had few peers when it came to packing Sixties dancefloors. The rasp of Pickett’s voice barking the instructions of songs like “In The Midnight Hour”, “Land Of 1000 Dances” and “Mustang Sally” was perfectly matched with the sticky funk-soul grooves created at Fame Studios in Muscle Shoals, to which he brought a dark, incendiary presence: not for nothing did the short-tempered singer acquire the nickname the Wicked Pickett, also the title of one of his best albums. This 10-CD set charts his tenure with Atlantic from the extraordinary highs of 1966’s  , through fruitful alliances with co-writer Bobby Womack, and guitar legind-in-waiting Duane Allman, to a less confident early Seventies when he was reduced to covering “Sugar, Sugar”. But he always had a keen ear for future funk possibilities:  , his undervalued final album for the label, anticipates developments subsequently capitalised upon by such as Curtis Mayfield, Willie Mitchell and Allen Toussaint. ★★★★★ If punk rock was a nihilist response to the tedium of prog rock, then new wave was an almost instant response to the tedium of punk rock. Barely was 1977 over before the earliest examples here, Magazine’s “Shot By Both Sides” and Wire’s “I Am The Fly”, were feverishly building on the scorched earth left behind. Both appeared on hippy labels (Virgin and Harvest), suggesting how this new exploratory approach paralleled the Sixties art-school takeover of the music mainstream. Though spanning just three short years, this five-CD set covers a huge range of new-wave innovation, spawned by the transformative effect of the DIY ethos, including pioneering work in agit-rock (Gang Of Four, Scritti Politti), feminist pop (The Raincoats, The Slits) and Goth (Joy Division, The Birthday Party). Meanwhile, bleeping away on primitive synths, outliers like The Human League, Gary Numan and Daniel Miller were quietly establishing the electropop that would take over the pop mainstream. A fascinating account of a brief period of intense, diverse innovation. ★★★★☆ Such is the range and duration of Elton John’s career that one expects a retrospective box set to indulge the variety of his work over six or seven discs. But Diamonds is an uncharacteristically modest affair, squeezing his highlights onto two CDs, bulked out with an additional third disc of “personal favourites” curated by Elton himself. It has to be said that the two main discs offer an extraordinary confirmation of his talent, almost three dozen tracks with barely a duff moment amongst them. But the third CD blots the copybook badly: in part, it seems like a misguided attempt to shoehorn in collaborations with the likes of Pavarotti, Dionne Warwick and LeAnn Rimes, when the only duet that really matters – George Michael’s transformative contribution to “Don’t Let The Sun Go Down On Me” – rightly features earlier as a highlight. Apart from that, it’s a motley selection of covers (“Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds”, “Pinball Wizard”), serious contenders (“Skyline Pigeon”, “This Train Don’t Stop There Anymore”), and the remix hook-up with PNAU that secured Elton’s most recent chart-topper.

" Now Hear This Playing catch-up after a week in Norway for Oya festival, I want you to check out Alaska-born singer Earl She grew up singing gospel in her local church choir before moving to LA - now based in London, she's signed to BMG and is working on a debut, which is set to be out in early 2017.  She's got a great voice and a pretty unique sound - the video for her single 'I Love You' has racked up an impressive 100k views over the last couple of weeks. Check it out and let me know what you think: I love so many genres of music. I’m into that song ‘Concrete' by Tom Odell and the accapella version of Ariana Grande singing 'Dangerous Woman', excellent. Otherwise it’s been the original 'Sing Sing Sing' by Benny Goodman and my budgie seems to enjoy singing along to Sia’s 'Cheap Thrills'.  Continuing with my collaborator Phil Thornalley - he’s so humble he never mentioned he produced The Cure. I mean THE CURE… And when we weren’t skinny dipping in the ocean, I did work on this co-write with Paloma Faith over in Hastings that one of my producers Blair Mackichan made happen. And I’ve been tweeting with Guy Chambers about writing the next one…. so I hope to have the album finished by Christmas. If being the worship leader at a church revival in rural Alaska doesn’t count, I’d have to say my first “artist” gig was at a coffee shopped called Perkatory in Jackson, Michigan where I attended a missionary program when I was 17. My bible school mates were on the fence about attending because the atmosphere of the venue was “secular”. But everyone knew the words to my song about wishing I could make cookies with Jesus, so they showed up and church sort of happened amidst the sound of grinding beans. It was a sight. The gig closest to my heart was opening for Damien Rice after he found me online. For some reason they decided to give me a standing ovation at the London Palladium. I’d never been to the UK before that. It made me want to come back. We use cookies to enhance your visit to our site and to bring you advertisements that might interest you.

" Artist shares cover after performing at Glastonbury Festival Hopefully you may remember us   back in 2016 - but even if you haven't, you definitely will have heard the new song she's covered. 'One Dance' by Drake was the biggest song of 2016 and one of the best-selling of all time (it currently boasts over 1.2 billion streams on Spotify). Earl has performed a sublime cover of the dancehall track in a session at Wilton Way which you can watch first below. Check it out: What I love about this is that she totally got the vibe that Drake has in the original song but made it entirely her own. We caught up with her in a quick Q&A to see what made her want to do the cover: 'Moola Mantra' by Deva Premal to raise the vibes, and country music because I'm in love with a Southern boy… 'Fire Away' by Chris Stapleton and ‘Vice' by Miranda Lambert I relate to that line - 'strength and guidance, that's all I'm wishing for my friends, nobody makes it from my ends I had to bust up the silence'. I feel that.  Being Filipino, I'm an island girl by blood. I may have grown up listening to Latin beats from my culture's love of ballroom music, but I still feel those reggae rhythms, those tropical vibes are global, I had to put them in. I knew it would turn the track on its head and give me a chance to show the listeners what I can do.  Taking my son to see his father in LA and then I'll head to spend some time where my soldier is stationed. I'm engaged to a military man. I never saw this one coming but he's my soul mate. I've never called anyone that before.  Proud of the journey I'm on and a little bewildered ... there's just so much I want to accomplish. I'm doing my best to enjoy the ride.  We use cookies to enhance your visit to our site and to bring you advertisements that might interest you. Read our   and   Policies to find out more.

" Five acts played to a packed-out venue in Leeds as part of the annual music festival Live At Leeds Festival took place just over a week ago. Drawing obvious comparisons to The Great Escape festival thanks to its knack for spotting some of the best new talent around and giving it a platform; the festival is held across multiple venues around the city.  This year  had its own stage that featured festival headliner Rag 'N' Bone Man, plus Indy favourites Tom Grennan, Fickle Friends, Clean Cut Kid and The Hunna.  There are some great shots of their performances which you can check out below: The Hunna are a rock band hailing from Hertfordshire in England. Formed in 2015, they've already claimed slots at Reading & Leeds and Dot to Dot Festival.  After doing a really beautiful (sideways - my bad) Facebook live with us on their tour bus before the gig, they absolutely killed their show opening up the Indy stage. The Refectory was rammed and I've not seen young fans go that wild for a band in some time, it was fantastic to see.  I haven't made a secret out of the fact that Tom Grennan is one of my favourite new artists to emerge this year/at the end of 2016.  Tom played the Indy stage just after a sold-out show at the stunning Union Chapel in London. This was the first time I'd seen him play with a full band - it added more weight to his music but didn't distract from his great charisma or that astonishing voice.  (ps. It's worth checking out the Music Box session Tom did to see what I mean). We p  back in March so were thrilled to have them perform on the Indy stage in Leeds. As a live band they're fantastic - they have so much energy and clearly love every moment of performing. Definitely try and catch them live during their tour, or in the perfect summer setting at   were ace today, such a great band good to catch their set.    Got to see my mates today.    One of the fastest-rising bands around, Clean Cut Kid make wonderfully romantic pop rock and have a backstory to match.  Their show was rammed with fans and they did it justice - playing tracks off their excellent debut album  which is out now.  It was brilliant catching up with Rory in Leeds after a whirlwind couple of months, where he won two Brit Awards and claimed the fastest-selling male debut  Having seen him do a couple of live shows we had no doubt this would be an epic show and he didn't disappoint - he and his band are cool as hell and his amazing voice never fails to make an impression.

" A striking Western, Ben Stiller’s latest vehicle, the story of a young Syrian refugee, and a Zen documentary ★★★★☆ Westerns don’t come much more brutal than Scott Cooper’s . The film has a few moments of  -like tranquillity right at the start. We see homesteader Rosalie Quaid (Rosamund Pike) sitting in the parlour, teaching her daughters how to use adverbs as her husband works outdoors, sawing wood. But then comes the slaughter: the scalping, the shooting, the wanton killing of children. From that point onwards, the tone doesn’t lighten. The Comanches are killers. Their homicidal behaviour is matched by that of the US army. Cooper casts us into a world in which violence and cruelty are endemic and in which men are murdered or tortured in front of their families as a matter of course. Captain Joe J Blocker is surely the darkest role that Christian Bale has yet tackled. The one-time child actor from  is here playing a grizzled, embittered old timer with a hangdog moustache whose hatred of Native Americans puts even that of John Wayne’s vengeful Ethan Edwards in   to shame. He’s rumoured to have taken “more scalps that Sitting Bull himself”. He can’t bear to be in a room with “those people”, as he calls his enemies. “I’ve killed savages; I’ve killed plenty of them because that’s my f***ing job,” he hisses. Blocker is utterly dismayed when his commanding officer orders him to lead a team accompanying cancer-ridden Cheyenne war chief Yellow Hawk (Wes Studi) back to his old hunting grounds in Montana to die. Yellow Hawk and Blocker provide a twisted reflection of one another. They’re both “butchers”. They’re also men out of time. It’s the 1890s and the old ways are changing. “Civilisation,” as represented by the banks, the politicians, the press and the railroads, is encroaching. The violence that has distorted both their lives will no longer be tolerated, at least in open view. They can hardly feel nostalgic but the peaceful future looks as bleak to them as the violent past. To call the mood here elegiac is to understate the matter. The journey shown is like a prolonged death march. At first, Pike’s Rosalie is so traumatised with grief that she becomes delusional but her endurance and will to survive hint at a chance of reconciliation and redemption. In its own sombre way.   is very striking. It boasts exceptional performances from Bale and Pike.There is a rugged beauty to its evocation of the Old West. Cooper throws in shots of dawn rising over the plains and plenty of majestic imagery of mountains, forests and deserts. At the same time, it makes for downbeat and forbidding viewing. It’s a film that begins and ends in loss. Much of the screenplay, which is based on a story written many years ago by Oscar-winning screenwriter Donald E Stewart, is predictable. The filmmakers go to such lengths early on to establish the enmity between Captain Blocker and Chief Yellow Hawk that we know they’ll soon find common ground. They may be killers but they have their own code of honour. Yellow Hawk is a Cheyenne, not a “rattlesnake” like the Comanches, who kill everyone indiscriminately. The film can’t make up its mind about human nature. The film suggests that religion and civilisation are no barriers when it comes to killing. Rosalie isn’t coy about emptying the barrels of a revolver into the corpse of a dead Comanche. Soldiers like Blocker and his old comrade Sergeant Metz (Rory Cochrane) are inured to violence. Metz even gets to deliver a little soliloquy which sounds nearly identical to the one Clint Eastwood uttered in   (1992) in which he talked of killing everything that moved, whether man, woman or child. At the same time, all the main characters here are consumed by a sense of longing and regret. is far too traditional to be seen as a revisionist western. Characters are seen framed in doorways, just as in  . There are echoes of Ford’s cavalry westerns and of his late films like   too. The explosions of violence rekindle memories of Sam Peckinpah. There is a morose and self-conscious quality to the storytelling that may put some audiences off but the film also stands as a reminded of why westerns continue to be made. If you want to deal with the most primal emotions in the most rugged settings, to combine action and soul-searching, this is still the genre to turn to first. ★★★☆☆ From the ageing Derek Zoolander to the day-dreaming Walter Mitty, Ben Stiller has portrayed his share of angst-ridden, middle-aged nincompoops trying to make sense of their inchoate lives. He gives an appealing performance in a very familiar type of role in writer-director Mike White’s comedy-drama,  .  Stiller plays Brad Sloan, a husband and father living a comfortable middle-class life in the suburbs of Sacramento. He runs a small non-profit company; is happily married to the ever-accommodating Melanie (Jenna Fischer), and they have a talented musician son, Troy (Austin Abrams), who is hoping to go to an Ivy League college.  Brad, though, is prey to extreme status anxiety. “There are moments you realise your entire life’s work is absurd and you have nothing to show for it,” he laments in the voiceover that runs through the film. “There’s no more potential. This is it.” His problem is not so much with what he has failed to achieve as his obsession with the success of his old college friends. They all seem so much more prosperous than he is. For him, the world is a battleground. For them, with their money, girlfriends and private jets, it’s a playground. When Brad accompanies Troy on a trip east to visit Harvard and Tufts (the colleges his son hope to attend), his paranoia mounts. Little indignities in airport check-in queues or at restaurants eat away at his sense of confidence. Writer-director White (who also scripted  ) keeps matters light. There are comical fantasy sequences in which Brad imagines the lives his friends are living or day dreams about successes he and his son might yet experience. Brad is neurotic and self-obsessed but Stiller plays him in good natured and comical fashion. As his exasperated but devoted son, continually being embarrassed by his antics, Austin Abrams is effectively his straight man. There are funny cameos from Luke Wilson and Jemaine Clement as the “friends” whose gilded lives he so envies. Michael Sheen is excellent value, too, as another of the friends, the preening, narcissistic Harvard professor/media celebrity Craig Fisher, who always gets the best table at restaurants and who, Brad thinks, relentlessly patronises him. Stiller can sometimes be a shrill or over-the-top screen presence. Here, he underplays and is all the more likeable as a result. The only downside is that the film sometimes feels as superficial as its central character. Brad’s problems, as his son’s friends point out to him, are strictly “first world” ones. He is not really having a mid-life crisis at all. It isn’t so much despair that has engulfed him as a very mild envy and irritation at the lives of others. It goes without saying that he completely misreads those lives anyway.  ★★★☆☆ The brilliant Hungarian director Kornel Mundruczo’s latest feature sits uncomfortably between political allegory and thriller. It’s the story of a young Syrian refugee who is shot as he crosses the border. Instead of dying of his wounds, Aryan (Zsombor Jeger) develops magical powers – he is suddenly able to levitate at will. Aryan is taken in hand by Gabor Stern (Merab Ninidz), a sleazy, conscience-torn doctor, still racked with guilt over his part in the death of a young patient. Gabor realises he can make money by showing off Aryan as if the refugee is a novelty act. Both men are being pursued by Lászlo (György Cserhalmi), a gnarled old police office, as relentless in hunting down his quarry as Inspector Javert in  . As in his earlier feature,  , Mundruczo shows the paranoia and racism in a Hungarian society in which outsiders are regarded with loathing and fear, shunned or treated as potential terrorists. However, rather than making a conventional political drama, the director turns to magical realism. There are obvious echoes of Wim Wenders’  . Aryan is the angel over Budapest, the other-worldly figure often shown up in the clouds, looking down on the city below. On a formal level, the film is very striking. Aryan will be seen hovering upside down in a hospital ward or gently floating above the traffic and buildings. Mundruczo treats the levitation scenes in a matter-of-fact fashion which makes them all the more startling. He throws in lengthy travelling shots in which the camera roams through the city as if it shares Aryan’s magical powers. There’s a tremendous car chase late on which unfolds at a ferocious pace but is seemingly filmed in a single shot. Ninidz’s Gabor is an engaging anti-hero, a crumpled opportunist who turns out to be more courageous and selfless than he first appears. Jeger’s Aryan, meanwhile, is the holy innocent type who doesn’t seem to understand his own powers. Where the film comes unstuck is in its use of hackneyed action movie clichés. The shoot-outs in hotel lifts and chases through basements and back streets play like scenes out of some low-grade  rip-off. These scenes seem all the more incongruous next to the meditative and poetic moments when Aryan takes wing. ★★☆☆☆  is a frustrating experience, a woolly minded documentary that doesn’t offer viewers the spiritual relief that its main protagonist, Zen Buddhist master Thich Nhát Hanh, clearly provides to his followers. The master, who left Vietnam in the mid-1960s and was forced into exile in France, is the founder of Plum Village, a rural retreat which (an intertitle tells us) is now one “of the world’s leading mindfulness practice centres”. Alongside the often exquisite imagery of dawns and dusks or scenes of chanting monks walking through the fields and having their heads shaven, there are recitations on the soundtrack from the teachings of the master. These are read in sonorous fashion by Benedict Cumberbatch. Directors Marc J Francis and Max Pugh have managed to get very close to their subject. This is an intimate portrait of the Zen master. One of its drawbacks, though, is that it tells us so little about him. The filmmakers’ observational style doesn’t allow space for interviews or voiceovers or for any meaningful contextualisation. They plunge us into the middle of the retreat. It’s debatable whether watching the master’s followers eating their breakfast in silence or watching them pray and chant takes us any closer to nirvana.  Late on, the filmmakers follow the master and the monks on a trip to the US, where his followers pack out theatres. We see the monks share their teachings at a correctional facility. They tell the inmates they have had to give up money, jobs and sex. Their lifestyle is based around meditation and discipline. The filmmakers are clearly trying to be as respectful as possible towards their subjects. That means they never ask the simple questions that an investigative journalist might have done. We don’t find out the back stories or even the names of the monks. Nor do we learn how Plum Village is financed.  “At that moment, I felt perfectly at peace. Not one sad or anxious thought entered my mind. Ideas of past, present and future dissolved,” Cumberbatch intones at one stage as we see a shot of a blackened sky with tiny stars in the background. We are told we are at “the luminous threshold of a reality that transcends time, space and action”. This is all very well but doesn’t make for either gripping or revealing viewing. When it comes to Zen and the art of movie making, Marvel’s   is much more fun than this. We use cookies to enhance your visit to our site and to bring you advertisements that might interest you.

" Something for the weekend London singer Malika has one of the most arresting voices to emerge from the city in a long time.  Picking up some obvious 90s and 00s R&B vibes - nodding to greats such as Brandy and Erykah Badu - she was recently featured on Snakehips' track 'Falling'.  To get you in the mood for the weekend and hopefully encourage some sunshine, we're premiering this gorgeous acoustic rendition of her track 'Run'. Check it out below: A mix of old school 90s R&B songs like Brandy and May, as well as a lot of new music. One of the things I do on a Friday is listen to Spotify's New Music Friday playlist and just leave it playing - doing that just gives you an instant feel for what's happening. Some of the new artists I really like at the moment include Weslee - their song Gassed is cool. I love Ella Mai - she just typifies what I love about R&B music. And I really like what J Hus is doing - I've worked with Jae5 his producer recently as well, and I’m loving the album! I have one more single dropping and then the release of my EP ‘Songs About C’. There are also a few live dates coming up too. I’m a summer baby, so for me it’s the best time of year, we have some amazing festivals in the UK during the summer, so I’ll be heading to a few to check out the acts and just soak up the vibe. I actually can’t remember my first gig - does a talent contest when i was 5 count?! The best so far probably has to be some dates I did with Snakehips last year. I got to perform our track ‘Falling’ in LA! I love the boys and the crowds were pretty amazing!

She enlisted her family for the retro-style DIY visuals, capturing the joy and freedom we all feel when we're belting out a great tune in the car.  Check it out below:  I’m listening to lots of funk and soul at the moment, a real mixture from Prince to Michael Jackson to   for inspiration for my new music.  2018 is a very important year for me, I’m looking forward to getting out and performing the songs from my EP live. I also have a few live sessions coming  up which I’m am really excited about sharing with everyone and of course, finally sharing the video for ‘I Live’ with everyone. I can’t remember the first gig, but the best so far has to be when I performing with   as part of the Redbull 30 days in LA Tour.

" From Lorde's unconventional pop to Rapsody's outstanding second album – here are our favourite releases from a busy year in music After last year’s spate of surprise releases from the likes of Beyoncé, Rihanna, Radiohead and Kanye West, 2017 has been more about anticipation. From the build-up to Kendrick Lamar dropping   and the frenzy ahead of Taylor Swift’s long-awaited sixth album  , to a wealth of long-awaited debuts: this year artists took their time to recover from political and social upheaval, and gave us something to look forward to. Here are our 30 favourite albums of 2017. “Basically we’re bringing it back to basics.” Some may have forgotten Loyle Carner’s jewel of a debut record, given that it was released right at the beginning of the year. Rebel Kleff’s old-school hip-hop production – pioneered by the likes of Wu-Tang Clan’s RZA and Q-Tip from A Tribe Called Quest – sees the album chop and change, throwing in 40-second skits and snapshots from Carner’s life, not a moment wasted.  There are twangs of guitar, funk-driven bass lines, gospel choruses, poetry, a saxophone, the gospel chant on “The Isle of Arran” that recalls “California Dreamin’” – and at the top of it all, Carner’s swift flow that switches up from a languid, poetic narrative on “No Worries” and “Mean It In The Morning” to a spitfire on tracks like “OCD” and “Stars & Shards”.  Like his heroes – Mos Def, Nas, Common, The Pharcyde, Benjamin Zephaniah – Carner has an astonishing ability to evoke the world that surrounds him, and he also shares their capacity for storytelling. We get a perfect balance between the influences he draws on from the best of US hip hop and the power of his own, distinctly south London voice. Carner wears his heart on his sleeve in everything that he does; there is not one moment on this record where he hides from his emotions. Family is at the heart of everything, from the charming conversation between him and his mother, where he allows her to call him a “shmoo”; the song “Florence”, where he imagines life with a baby sister; to the closing title track, which features recordings by his late, beloved step-father.   is an outstanding debut by one of the UK’s finest young talents – an album you find yourself returning to again and again.  “Unconventional pop that still bangs” was how we described Lorde’s follow-up to her acclaimed debut  . Working mostly in New York with producer Jack Antonoff (Bleachers, St Vincent, Taylor Swift), Lorde created an album that documents feelings of early adulthood, spanning desire, heartbreak, fear, certainty. She captures how it feels as a young person living in a huge city with millions of people, and to still feel lonely. Her songwriting talent combined with Antonoff’s production means  sounds like nothing else released this year. You hear it most on opener “Green Light” (which producer Max Martin called “incorrect songwriting”) and the way she blurts out that intro with fury so tangible it makes you shiver, before throwing you head-first into the intoxicating chorus, revelling in its chaos. Non-rhymes and that key change, possibly one of the most talked-about in music history, are superb. And it continues throughout, there is no filler on this record, and each song stands out, quite exquisitely, on its own. Read the full review  . Rapsody is arguably one of the most underappreciated names in hip hop. The Roc Nation MC was one of the best features on Kendrick’s   (“Complexion”), and has since enlisted him for her second record – the first to be released on Roc; alongside a wealth of other brilliant guest appearances including Anderson .Paak, Busta Rhymes, Amber Navran and Terrace Martin. It’s an album that buzzes with life, and is impossible to pre-empt, with scope to become a classic.   Opening the title track on a sample from Aretha Franklin’s “(To Be) Young Gifted and Black”, she loops the church piano and regales the listener with her grandmother’s advice for life. Her flow is graceful and full of light; her skilful wordplay seemingly effortless. “You won’t need no toll booths, they’ll pay attention, Hov do,” she asserts, nodding to her label’s boss Jay Z. “Pay Up” is an outstanding, funk-driven riff off TLC’s “No Scrubs” or Destiny’s Child’s “Independent Woman”.  It’s an ambitious work: 14 tracks and with many passing the four-minute mark, but rare in that it took two years to complete, with the intention apparently to produce a work that was considered, ready and artful. Rapsody is a natural storyteller taking the listener along for the ride, and the way she tells those stories is so utterly visual; she paints a mural of her life as a black female artist in the 21st century and tackles subjects including police brutality, social media and life in the South.  On  Mike Hadreas shows the gentle, sacred love of a long-term relationship. Its sheer interpretability is what makes it so special, written by a restless artist during a number of different moods, the listener is able to take from it what they will.  His writing about long-term partner Alan Wyffels is raw and passionate yet at the same time endearingly normal. On “Alan” he wonders at the state of domestic bliss he finds himself in: “I’m here,” he sings. “How weird.” The long-awaited album from an artist who has written for everyone from Nicki Minaj to Rihanna to Beyonce. Originally titled  it was meant to conclude a trilogy of self-titled releases after  [2013] and [2014]. SZA’s voice is dreamy and fluid, navigating through themes of youth, identity and femininity. She doesn’t set out with any one statement, choosing instead to explore those ideas as she goes along, wondering aloud to herself and allowing the listener to hear those musings in the same vein as Frank Ocean. On “Doves In The Wind” you hear a classic Kendrick beat before SZA comes in and sings “I’m really tryna crack off that headboard” with sweetly brazen tones that recall Prince at his sexiest. It’s the versatility that makes this album, with neo-soul and touches of indie rock alongside trap production that all settles around her voice and her words, her fearlessness to say actually, this is a s*** situation. On her debut, SZA proves that the dark times can be presented just as beautifully as the good. “The trip-hop rhythms may have been replaced by a more varied range of beats, from the languid funk groove of “Freakshow” to the de-syncing drum machines of “One More Sip”, but the mood and manner of Ghostpoet (Obaro Ejimiwe)’s fourth album is steeped in much the same themes and textures, hauled up to date and delivered in a nonchalant deadpan akin to Roots Manuva.” ‘s album critic Andy Gill awarded Ghostpoet’s record five stars, praising how a song like “Live>Leave” uses a “shifting backdrop of flanged guitar and sporadic piano chords over an itchy drum shuffle to carry its tableau of cramped, paranoiac millennial hedonism struggling with forces beyond its control”. Elsewhere he commented on how grim realities such as the drowning refugee in “Immigrant Boogie” work against the chipper mood on the likes of “Woe Is Meee”, where Ojimiwe claims, “I had a dance with the devil, I couldn’t keep his pace”.  “Assisted by producer/guitarist Leo Abrahams, whose work with artists such as Brian Eno, Karl Hyde and David Holmes equipped him perfectly to bathe Ojimiwe’s images in swaddling guitars and illuminating sonic details,” Gill concludes, “the result is a great album that bodes well for Ghostpoet’s future: as he says: ‘Eyes wide like a flatscreen/I haven’t reached my peak’.” Read the full review  . Wu-Tang Clan’s RZA told  : “We’re lucky hip hop has a Kendrick.” The release of K Dot’s fourth studio record marked another masterpiece for the rap canon; the master storyteller outstripping his closest competitors once again in a work that was impossible to second-guess.  Where on   Lamar took a blisteringly scathing look at the world around him, on   he ventures deeper into his own mind, apparently exhausted by the pressure from fans, peers and critics to be this constant pioneer, offering up what most fans would identify as a “traditional” rap album to date, of course with his own, post-modern detours. Throughout the record he seems to tackle his own contradictory feelings about his status as an artist. When he screams “bitch, be humble” on “Humble”, you wonder if he’s talking to himself or to any foolish challengers. On “Pride” he quips, “I can’t fake humble just ‘cause your ass is insecure”, and on “Loyalty” his boasts are held up as weaknesses. Just as   was a look at his creative process,   allows the listener to peer inside the mind of a true genius. Swirling blue pools and sprawling, oceanic landscapes are brought to mind on Syd’s resplendent album  named after the fish appendage rather than signifying the end of something.  She admitted that her solo work was “not that deep”, but it did mark a descent to the depths she wanted the internet to get into. Yet she embraces with ease the influence of Nineties R&B: TLC, Aaliyah, Erykah Badu, with her husky, languid drawl and half-whispers that slink around album highlights “Body” and “Know”.  In a genre dominated by heteronormative romantic cliches, it’s refreshing to hear her singing from a female, gay perspective, yet still with the half-rap braggadocio flow that makes her so compelling.  Not one of these songs sound the same. Even on the best albums that’s a hard thing to avoid – often an artist wants to keep exploring a sound or thought but transfers too much across to other songs so they lose their uniqueness; Ware combats this by bringing on, at various times, the likes of Benny Blanco, Happy Perez, Cashmere Cat and Ed Sheeran.  What Ware’s songs on Glasshouse do have in common is that they are all quietly, beautifully poignant. Many of them were written after giving birth to her daughter, in those weary hours of early parenthood. On “Selfish Love” her voice over the Flamenco guitar is lustful, as fiery-yet-restrained as the dance itself, nodding to our current fascination with Latin American music without  Pino Palladino’s bass on the album’s final track “Sam”, co-written by Ware and Ed Sheeran, melts into that outro of Nico Segal’s trumpet and gentle cymbals. Sheeran often works best as a songwriter for women, managing not to trigger the audience’s cringe muscle with false sincerity that can appear in his own music, and instead simply guiding Ware to a sweetly disarming tribute to her husband and child.  “It’s taken me a whole lifetime to write this album, so maybe you can spare me 51 minutes of yours to give it a listen. That’s not even an hour. It’s quicker than an enema, and more fun.” It felt as though fans had been waiting an age for the release of this Welsh rock band’s debut album – as their frontman admits, it’s taken a lifetime to write. Led by Jack Jones, who has established himself not only as a resident poet for The Libertines, but also as the guitarist in Pete Doherty’s band the Puta Madres, Trampolene’s   intersperses poetry with rock music in a way few artists dare to do today.  It’s the range of classic rock sounds on this record, made at Ray Davies’ Konk Studios in Hornsey, that’s particularly impressive, from a Buzzcocks snarl on the chorus of “Alcohol Kiss” to the Queens of the Stone Age nods for “Primrose Hill – 5th September”.  Opener “Artwork of Youth” is a poem recalling old schoolmates that Jones recites with a ready weariness. Moods that run through this record are gritty and tumultuous; disenchanted youth trying to “get f***ed for a fiver” on “Dreams so Rich, Life so Poor” and feeling as though all the doors have been bricked up. Their reference points are as versatile as any release this year – Patti Smith, Oasis, Dylan Thomas, Pete Doherty – there are frantic drum beats, screeching guitars and Jones’ Welsh tones which meander from a soft rasp and up to a raucous shout on “The Boy That Life Forgot”.  Few could make a song about Poundland seem as poignantly humorous or charming. So much of   feels like self-flagellation, on a lyric like: “Please insert your meaningless life/Into the chip and pin device.” Jones bleeds on these songs. J Hus exploded into the mainstream consciousness with what could be held up as the sound of London, 2017, a heady mix of grime, hip hop, garage and afrobeats, with some jazz horns thrown in for good measure. Critics desperate to find an emerging grime artist to rave about after missing the boat with Stormzy would be disappointed; Hus skips round any chance to pigeonhole him with one genre.  Jae5’s beats nod to 90s garage on “Plottin’” then jump forward to minimalist trap music on Hus’s monster hit “Did You See”. His music sounds older than his years, the 21-year-old weaves stories with deft skill and fills them with colour; his mood changes as swiftly as the beat, from self-deprecating to menacing to pure cheek. It’s a thrilling work to listen to when you consider what he must have in store for 2018.  Under his latest alias, Archy Marhsall releases perhaps his most concrete effort to date. Still only 23 years old, he has fun on this album, stretched across it like some sleepy big cat, flexing its claws – as much fun as someone as conflicted-sounding as he does can.  “I think she thinks I’m bipolar,” he drones on opener “Biscuit Town”, drawing on the sort of woozy early Noughties jazz-rock favoured by Mr Scruff or DJ Yoda. He seems haunted by Tom Waits on “Slush Puppy” where he howls “nothing’s working with me/nothing’s working with me”.  It’s far from the most upbeat of records put out this year, but you don’t always want that. This is music to put on when you’re in a slump, at least to know that someone else is in the same melancholy mood.   is the long-awaited record that didn’t disappoint, where the debut effort from the breakout grime star switched up from cold diss tracks to the gorgeous devotional hymn “Blinded By Your Grace Pt 2”. It’s the self-awareness that sparks your attention on this record; he earns a chuckle on the Latin-influenced “Cold” when he muses: “I’ve been cold the whole season/I should call my next one Freezin’!”. On “First Things First”, as hard as he sounds he also opens up about mental health, breaking down boundaries in genre and society.  That and the sheer energy of the thing. The 23-year-old born Michael Omari is unstoppable and if you can’t keep up that’s your problem. “Big For Your Boots” – produced by Sir Spyro and Adele collaborator Fraser T Smith – is a ferocious smack-down to anyone trying to challenge him.  St Vincent’s new album  is new pop art: the bold block colours and the dynamics on this record are phenomenal, her songwriting is intelligent and the touches on production from Jack Antonoff it one of the best pop records of the year.   Annie Clark’s latest record is supposed to be her most revealing; it focuses on themes of “power and sex, imperilled relationships and death”. Our critic Andy Gill noted: “The androgyne appeal and fast, chattering synths of “Sugarboy” recall the sensuous entreaties of Goldfrapp, establishing a more direct electropop style also used on “Fear The Future”, which hurtles into uncertainty on a juddering synth pulse, and the punningly-titled single “Los Ageless”, a snarky dig at vampiric Hollywood celebrocracy.” Read the full review  . Sometimes owning up to your own indiscretions can be the best therapy. On   Jay Z addresses the accusations that appeared in his wife Beyonce’s groundbreaking work Lemonade, that sparked countless articles speculating on the state of their relationship.   is the latest chapter in the fascinating story that is the Knowles-Carter family, an album where Jay Z apologies for infidelity, challenges his own ego, and opens up about his personal life more than than he ever has previously. On “Smile” he seems to reveal that his mother is a lesbian: “Had to pretend so long, she’s a thespian,” he raps with some heartbreak for the woman who raised him and his three siblings.  Then on “Family Feud” he most explicitly refers to the rumours that swirled around Beyonce’s fearsome “Sorry” where she says, catastrophically: “He only want me when I’m not there/He better call Becky with the good hair.” There are several Jay Z albums you could hold up as being superior in terms of production and creativity, but it was the depth of thought and self-flagellation on this record that makes it stand out among the rest.  In the space of five years, LA rapper Vince Staples has released six entirely different projects, consistently shying away from attempts to define him by refusing to produce two comparable works. On   – his second studio album – he brings together a glimmering dance electronic groove and old school hip hop. It’s an experience – one that profiles Staple’s exceptional skill with narrative, and while it may drift in mood (far more than 2015’s  ), it holds him up alongside the likes of Kanye West and Childish Gambino. On closer “Rain Come Down”, a beat from Los Angeles’s Zach Sekoff provides a trembling bassline that he follows with a stream-of-consciousness meander. Staples himself has spoken about his futuristic approach and you wonder if his audience are able to keep up with him. If they are, it’s quite the adventure.  Villains is all about shock factor. It’s in the drama of opener “Feet Don’t Fail Me”, that thudding, tribal war cry that spills out ahead of the synths and that juddery, ecstatic guitar riff.  Mark Ronson is likely the last producer fans would expect them to team up with, yet his expertise in funk suits this album perfectly, lifting their trademark robot-rock into something you can dance to. “Life is hard, that’s why no one survives,” sings Josh Homme, “but I’m older than I thought I would be.” He’s having too much fun to stop the party.  Critic Andy Gill observed how “Villains Of Circumstance”, a “heavy-hearted separation plaint sung by Homme with a wan vulnerability that recall Bernard Sumner”, provides a counterbalance to the brash “Un-Reborn Again” “I kid you not, it’s like a slowed-down ‘Telegram Sam’ sung by the Bowie of ‘The Man Who Sold The World’,” Gill wrote. “Extraordinary!” Sampha Sisay’s father brought a piano into the family home in Morden, south London, when he was three years old, and it seems to be at the heart of this Mercury Prize-winning album.  His husky, delicate falsetto skims gently over each note, cracking with quiet grief on “No One Knows Me Like The Piano” then rising for the dark theatrics of “Blood On Me”. Throughout the spare electro-soul you feel him speaking to his parents, a man still coping with loss, and addressing his own health struggles: “Sleeping with my worries,” he sings on opener “Plastic 100ºC”, “I didn’t really know what that lump was.” It’s a record to break your heart. Undoubtedly one of the most anticipated album releases of the year, Taylor Swift’s sixth record reputation is also one of her best, where on certain songs she seems more willingly vulnerable than she’s ever been, and others she seems the most menacing.  Waiting for boys on white horses is a thing of the past; Swift doesn’t need her lover to save her, as she notes on album standout “Call It What You Want”. Rather endearingly using British slang (“fit like a daydream”) she also sings about how he “loves me like I’m brand new”, forcing the listener to think of the list of famous ex-boyfriends the media  – and the public – insists Swift carry around wherever she goes. Producer Antonoff’s work on this record is essential. His love of Eighties synth-pop is the perfect counterbalance to Max Martin and Shellback’s dance and electronic touch; the album’s structure alternates between the two. On “Getaway Car” Swift emulates one of Antonoff’s favourites, Kate Bush, as she yells “go, go, go!”, while the song in its entirety recalls Bonnie Tyler’s “Total Eclipse of the Heart” – cellos and violins enhancing the drama.  One of Swift’s greatest talents is to encapsulate those small moments, often in a new relationship, that you as a listener cannot. There are very few faults in her songwriting on reputation, and it helps push across this idea of a multi-faceted pop artist who is, once again, at the top of her game.  Bonobo, aka Simon Green, is fascinated by the landscapes of Death Valley. Coming from the UK, with its (often damp) green woodland, the electronic artist delved into these alien landscapes and proceeded to paint his own; the sounds he uses tend to come from acoustic sources and he steers clear of digitally created noise, preferring to craft a human warmth: a montage of sounds that have been re-contextualised then put back together again. Those hip-hop influences from some of his earliest work seem to have come full circle – Migration features less of the explicit jazz influences heard on his first three albums, but continues that “cut-and-paste” sample culture. When there’s so much music you can listen to on the go, absent-mindedly flipping to another track when you’re only halfway through the first, Bonobo offers something to sit down and listen to, and allow yourself to be transported to another place.  On her latest record Lana Del Rey is far more self-aware than she has been on her previous albums, where her lyrics – often fetishising the tragic heroine, death and toxic relationships – quickly grew tiresome. By  , the follow-up to 2012’s  , it felt that she needed new things to sing about, or at least a new way to sing about them. On the title track, her duet with The Weeknd proves a masterful pairing, they stand out among their peers as two artists who have succeeded at crafting their own myth at a time where no piece of information seems off-limits, and “too much information” is the menu du jour for far too many celebrities. Like The Weeknd’s personal dark brand of R&B; Del Rey’s deliciously twisted pop fuses hip hop beats with her breathy vocal delivery;  ’s power is in its ability to keep things hidden, whilst seeming utterly explicit. It’s a heady mix to be caught up in. The National’s seventh album is about marriages falling apart, according to its frontman Matt Berginer. “It is not a happy album,”   But as we said with SZA, the dark times can be just as beautiful as the good.   is the band’s biggest departure from what many fans would consider their trademark sound: electronic influences crept in and Bryce Dessner’s forays into film composing seemed to have a positive impact on its gorgeous, textured instrumentation. This year’s EOY round-ups have (so far) largely featured just one emerging country artist, the gravelly tones of one Colter Wall, who is undoubtedly one of the year’s most exciting new voices. Yet it’s the softly spoken Brent Cobb who finds his way onto this particular end of year list, an artist whose songwriting skills have made their way to singers including Miranda Lambert, Luke Bryan and Little Big Town.  , Cobb’s debut, was produced by his cousin Dave, whose work helped propel Chris Stapleton to wider fame. It lingers over the finer details of a tall tale. On “Down In The Gulley” he imagines with humorous detail if his grandfather had kept an illegal moonshine distillery. It’s a humour that crops up plenty of times on the record: on “Diggin’ Holes” he considers how he manages to get himself into scrapes, despite his best intentions.  On its deeply affecting title track, Cobb strips everything back and lets his voice and his songwriting do the work, singing: “Ain’t it funny how a little thunder/Makes a man start to wonder/Should he swim or just go under?” It’s utterly timeless; an album that suspends you in the moment and makes you want to linger for a while.  Would you expect Charlotte Gainsbourg’s first LP in seven years to start like a missing part of Daft Punk’s   soundtrack? Probably not, but it does. Sung mostly in French, Gainsbourg’s latest work documents a woman trying to help her sister battle mental illness; her own half-sister Kate Barry, the photographer, died from what was presumed to be suicide after falling from a window in 2013.  Her film background is perfect for Rest’s haunting instrumentation: vast expanses that explore her grief in uncomfortable detail. The title track – the song written closest to Barry’s death – uses French-English wordplay to heartbreaking effect as she sings in trembling falsetto: “reste” (“rest” in English or “stay” in French) over Guy Manuel de Homem-Christo’s synths. Either interpretation is devastating.  Thundercat’s third album is a 23-track tumble down the rabbit hole.  s album critic Andy Gill wrote: “His nimble, knuckle-knotting basslines to tracks like “Uh Uh” suggest many an hour glued to Stanley Clark albums, though Thundercat’s fast-edit changes – switching abruptly between cool jazz, prog-fusion and sleek soul – along with his liking for weird time-signatures and even weirder lyrics, suggest an affinity for Frank Zappa and George Clinton.” Read the full review  . Greg Gonzalez’s half-asleep voice is hypnotic as anything else released this year. The frontman of the Brooklyn-based band begins their debut album by singing of his infatuation with a woman called Kristen.  “We had made love earlier that day, with no strings attached/But I could tell that something had changed,” he sings. It’s an album of love songs, but as millennials would understand them: of one-word texts and f***ing someone because an app said you matched. Earlier this year, Gonzalez made   a  . A lot of the songs he chose were about goodbyes. If anything Gonzelez’s searching, introspective gaze is the antithesis to The 1975’s noisy  , exploring similar themes but without the self-important posturing.   On “Affection” you hear the pain of a relationship that has grown toxic. The narrator attempts to persuade himself and his lover otherwise; his vocal delivery and the yearning guitar skating across a fragile beauty that can break your heart and mend it all at once.  It seemed as though the world only really caught up with Jack Antonoff in 2017. From his work with Lorde on her superb second album   to Taylor Swift’s sixth record  , he has fast-become one of the most in-demand pop producers of the year.  On his own project, Bleachers, a second LP builds on Antonoff’s love for anthemic Eighties pop – Kate Bush, Bowie, Tom Petty – and excels with that stadium-filling ecstasy, but also on quieter moments such as “All My Heroes Get Tired”, that builds in expectation but leaves the listener with painful suspense.  The War On Drugs’ first album for Atlantic Records would always struggle to live up to fan expectations, lifted by their 2014 breakout  What it does succeed in is a sweeping grandeur that brings out some of the most exquisite arrangements of singer/writer Adam Granduciel’s career. Nothing is overly cluttered, despite the frontman having 10 instrument credits on one track (as well as singing) and the album is powered by a new purpose he seems to have fund in a year of writing and recording, his commitment to the band sounding stronger than ever.  When they arrived on the scene with their outstanding debut   in 2009, it felt as though the London trio were ahead of the times in the way they expressed their feelings of anxiety and human fragility; in a tone that was both tentative and heartbreakingly confessional. Now, inspired by the sunshine and sweeping landscapes of LA and Iceland, where they recorded , the band succeed in bringing some light into the picture while also acknowledging that some of those feelings of anxiety or inadequacy are still there.  “Brave For You” sees Romy Madley Croft confront deeply personal issues involving family; her quavering voice ripples across sparse, respectful instrumentation: “So I will be brave for you/ Stand on a stage for you/ Do the things that I’m afraid to do.” The xx have maintained that element of mystique which is so vital for their music. They are exciting precisely because they refuse to reveal everything about themselves, and because there is an ambiguity to be found in lyrics that come across as bluntly personal. It’s a talent that was present in their first two albums, only this time, they’ve let the light in a bit. Saviour has her mentor Alex Turner’s keen ability for a turn of phrase. Record companies approached her when she was 16 years old, but she declined offers to make her the next Katy Perry. She met the Arctic Monkeys frontman in LA, where they enlisted producer James Ford [  Arctic Monkeys] and created a debut album that fits.  There’s a calm insolence in her voice on opener “Mirage” – and throughout the record, even as she sings on “Audeline”: “He spends his days with What’s-Her-Face.” Yet underneath that apparent nonchalance there’s a bitter restlessness that sees her sway from the sort of film siren ennui of Lana Del Rey on “Bones” to a Turner-esque drawl on “’Til You’re Mine”.

" Nile Rodgers has spoken about the recording Today (8 January 2018) would have been  ’s 71st birthday.  To celebrate, a previously unreleased demo of the Nile Rodger’s produced track ‘Let’s Dance’ has been released, featuring some slightly different guitar parts but retaining the track’s disco funk. At the end of the demo, Bowie can be heard celebrating, saying “That’s it, that’s it! Got it! We got it!” Listen via Spotify below. The song was originally featured on the 1983 album of the same name which Bowie recorded at his Switzerland home alongside the Chic guitarist.  Speaking about those early recording sessions, Rodger’s said: “I’ve been blessed with a wonderful career but my creative partnership with David Bowie ranks very, very, very high on the list of my most important and rewarding collaborations.  “This demo gives you, the fans, a bird’s eye view of the very start of it! I woke up on my first morning in Montreux with David peering over me.

" Kendrick Lamar performed the halftime show at college football's CFP National Championship Game in Atlanta last night, an event which was also attended by one Donald J. Trump. The president took to the field for the National Anthem ahead of the clash between Alabama and Georgia, before Kendrick became the focal point at halftime. The spiritual leader of the hip-hop community who raps extensively about politics and social issues,  , but this didn't come to pass. This was possibly down to the fact that Trump reportedly left before the halftime show, but there was still the opportunity for Kendrick to address the fact that he had just shared a stadium with the president, a natural enemy, perhaps telling him to: Sit down. Be humble. The reason why Kendrick chose not to reference him, however, is probably because it simply isn't his style. I mean, it's like beating a dead horse, he previously told   with regard to talking about Trump on track. We already know what it is. On 'The Heart Part 4' last year he did say: Donald Trump is a chump, know how we feel, punk? / Tell 'em that God comin' and Russia need a replay button, y'all up to somethin', but even then it didn't feel like his heart was really in it. K-Dot is not the kind of guy to take a cheap pop, to reductively minimise his thoughts/oppositions into a viral soundbite.   was his first album release since Trump's election, but even then he still kept his thoughts more atomised. Tempting though it may be to verbally obliterate one man, Kendrick has thus far maintained his focus, concentrating more on things like the atmosphere that lead to the election of Donald Trump than the election itself.

" Californian singer denies song 'Get Free' was 'inspired' by band's 1992 hit  are suing   for allegedly copying their 1992 hit Creep, the US singer has said. The Oxford band are said to have taken legal action over similarities between their song and Del Rey's Get Free. The Californian confirmed rumours of the copyright lawsuit on Twitter. She said Radiohead were demanding 100 per cent of the royalties for her song, from the 2017 album  . It's true about the lawsuit, she wrote. Although I know my song wasn't inspired by Creep, Radiohead feel it was and want 100% of the publishing - I offered up to 40 over the last few months but they will only accept 100. Their lawyers have been relentless, so we will deal with it in court. It’s true about the lawsuit.

" Last year’s figures show Sheeran scored the biggest album, single and online streaming numbers – but emerging, homegrown talent also has plenty to sing about If there was any doubt whatsoever that Ed Sheeran was the biggest artist of 2017, the   should remove it.  The trade body has revealed that UK music fans streamed more music than ever last year – a total of 68.1 billion songs – and a lot of it was by the “Shape of You” hitmaker.  Sheeran had four of the top 10 biggest-selling singles of the year, according to the report, and managed to sneak not one but two albums into the top 10 (combined sales and streams).     came out on top, but his second record,  also managed to score the number 6 spot, above records released last year including Liam Gallagher’s  and Stormzy’s  Sheeran’s four tracks in the Top Singles of 2017 were: “Shape of You”, “Castle on the Hill”, “Galway Girl” and “Perfect”. Other artists with top singles included Rag ’N’ Bone Man with “Human”, Luis Fonsi & Daddy Yankee with “Despacito” and Jax Jones ft Raye with the catchy “You Don’t Know Me”.  Overall the UK music industry saw the fastest growth in consumption this millennium across all formats. UK acts accounted for eight out of 10 of the best-selling albums, with emerging, homegrown solo acts such as Stormzy, Dua Lipa, J Hus, Loyle Carner and Sampha proving major forces for the British market.  Geoff Taylor, chief executive of BPI and the Brit Awards, said: “Demand for music in the UK is growing fast, driven by brilliant British artists such as Ed Sheeran, Sam Smith, Rag ’N’ Bone Man, Little Mix, Stormzy and Dua Lipa and the innovative music industry that supports them.  “Whilst the rapid growth of streaming and resilient demand for physical formats gives us confidence for the future, it is important to remember that the music industry still has a long way to go to recover fully. Structural challenges must be overcome if long-term growth is to be sustained.” Mr Taylor noted it was vital for the Government to ensure musicians are able to tour freely after Britain leaves the EU.  “We should make the UK the best place to invest in new content by forging an online environment that is safe for consumers and where illegal sites cannot flourish,” he concluded. “If we do this, the future for British music, which is already one of our leading exports, will be very bright.” We use cookies to enhance your visit to our site and to bring you advertisements that might interest you.

" Plus Jim Ghedi​ – A Hymn For Ancient Land, The Wailin’ Jennys​ – Fifteen, Edith Piaf​ – Edith Piaf, and Foy Vance – Live In London Artist, poet, illustrator, philosopher, cartoonist – so broad are Peter Blegvad’s other interests, and so protean his muse, that one sometimes has to wait for years for his attention to turn again to music. But the payoff lies in the way that those other pursuits feed back into his music in the form of songs that exult in their uniqueness. Blegvad is one of pop’s very few “true originals” whose work always bears out that status. Probably best known for Leviathan, his long-running   cartoon strip, Blegvad brings a similar level of abstruse conjecture and whimsical wordplay to his lyrics, whether he’s musing, in “Sven”, upon a leathery ancient corpse preserved “in a Finnish fen”, or offering a grim reflection, in “Mind The Gap”, on how a terrorist bomb destroys the collective isolation of Tube travellers: “Blown apart and blown together, now the two of us were one”. However, it’s not usually that dark: “Too Much” is a jaunty ragtime rumination on excess, slipping from familiar physical indulgence to more abstract realms (“too much sturm, too much drang, too much yin, too much yang”); and in “My Father’s Face”, Blegvad pirouettes on the cusp of whimsy and something more sinister, relating how he once drew his sleeping father, then erased his face. But perhaps his most elegant and amusing aesthetic reflection resides in “Way To Play The Blues”, where he uses John Cage’s epigram “I have nothing to say and I am saying it, and that is poetry as I need it” as inspiration for a (probably apocryphal) tale of the Stones asking Blegvad to help them understand the way to play the blues, a question he denudes of dues, and ultimately of volition. Blegvad’s band, comprising various Henry Cow alumni and sundry avant-gardists, provides flexible support for his musings, from the sinister cod-reggae shuffle of “Penny Black”, about a cursed stamp, to the more indefinable brew of languid, jazzy raunch-rock conjured to convey the enigmatic villain of “Had To Be Bad”. Elsewhere, there’s an aptly Kevin Ayers-y air to the Provençal tableau “Cote D’Azur”, while “God Detector” adopts a suitably Dylanesque tone for the tale of a man with a machine he claims can trace divinity – for which, of course, he searches in vain amongst humanity. If there is a unifying theme to the album, it’s probably to be found in the reflections upon dissipation and the futility of ambition in songs such as “Simon At The Stone” and “Winner Came There None” – songs which don’t so much disparage notions of being and doing, as prompt enquiry about the limitless ranges of experience, and their comparative values. This second album from Sheffield guitarist Jim Ghedi is infused with a strong sense of place, in tunes and settings that seem to ooze from the ground itself. Guitar and harp spin a gently undulating waltz around “Cwm Elan”, while a miasmic thrum of bowed and plucked strings evoke the ancient, mythic origins of Scotland’s 2000-year-old “Fortingall Yew”. But Ghedi’s main focus is his home of Moss Valley, on Sheffield’s Derbyshire border: “Home For Moss Valley” opens the album with glints of steel guitar and violin, before developing a raga-like texture of tingling drones and jaunty picking that recalls both John Fahey and the Penguin Cafe. The rickety percussion, slide and guitar picking of the fracking-threatened “Bramley Moor” trot along sweetly in the manner of Michael Chapman; and “Phoenix Works” disinters a verse by blacksmith Joseph Rippon to memorialise the valley’s long-gone scythe-making industry, the hammer blows evoked by a steady percussive thud, whilst guitar, strings and brass dance ever more forcefully around it. On his debut album, Kentuckian country newcomer Tyler Childers echoes John Donne in his desire to be saved, but not just yet. Opener “I Swear (To God)” sets the tone with a cantering celebration of à la carte good-time exploits with a side order of hankering for salvation, a theme taken up later in “Honky Tonk Flame” and “Whitehouse Road”, a swaggering country rocker in which the heady buzz of moonshine and cocaine is conveyed by the woozy twang of Jew’s harp. Elsewhere, he finds new wrinkles in classic tropes such as the murder ballad (“Banded Clovis”) and love lament (“Tattoos”), musing in the latter on how his name upon her skin now remains as “a haunted tale for someone else” when she disrobes; whilst bringing a whole new meaning with the regeneration theme of “Born Again”: Buddhist country, anyone? Produced by Sturgill Simpson and David Ferguson, the arrangements offer a feisty take on bluegrass mountain music which sets off Childers’ perkily engaging delivery splendidly. The winsome charm of The Wailin’ Jennys’ first album in six years is utterly irresistible, and all the more impressive for the speed of its creation. Convening from across the North American continent, whilst restrained by the sweet shackles of motherhood, Ruth Moody, Heather Masse and Nicky Mehta had but a one-week window in which to choose songs and settings, arranging harmonies on the fly for a sweet selection of covers ranging from Paul Simon’s “Love Me Like A Rock” – done a cappella with finger clicks and foot stomps – to a heartbreaking version of Warren Zevon’s valedictory farewell “Keep Me In Your Heart”. Banjo, mandolin, guitar and violin lend a suitably old-timey bluegrass feel to Tom Petty’s “Wildflowers”, but elsewhere the trio’s braided, balm-like vocals are mostly delivered purely a cappella, their hums eliding into harmonies on Dolly Parton’s “Light Of A Clear Blue Morning”, and blanketing Emmylou Harris’s achingly beautiful “Boulder To Birmingham”. Dusting down his Get Cape persona after several albums under his own name, Sam Duckworth finds the world a tough place to understand on  . In particular, the realisation is dawning that the comforting delusions of adolescence are little use in confronting the perplexities of adulthood – as he concedes in “Man2Man”, “walking the same old path isn’t quite going to plan”. But it’s altogether too late to be railing against “generational apathy”, as Duckworth does in “Adults”, while his reflections on rejection and incompatibility in songs such as “Always” and “Invisible” hardly profit from being so glumly humdrum. The diluted-pop character of the arrangements doesn’t help, their blandly propulsive blends of guitar and organ failing to rouse interest until he conjures up a burst of retro-electropop fizz for “VHS Forever”, cheesy enough to match the rhyming of “Nietzsche” with “pizza”. But even here, he seems mired in old battles – and as he acknowledges, “what’s a battle cry if it falls on deaf ears?”. As with Billie Holiday, there’s a danger that Edith Piaf’s artistry is sometimes stained by the way her own life slipped perilously close to soap opera. In eschewing such overtly melodramatic aspects without diminishing her interpretive gifts, this compilation packs more potency than previous Piaf anthologies, not least for its partial focus on the immediate postwar years of her career, when she was accompanied by the vocal nonet Les Compagnons De La Chanson. Having to share lead duties with the group’s charismatic Fred Mella, and work with their complex vocal arrangements, imposed a discipline which enabled Piaf to draw the most from songs like the hit “Les Trois Cloches” – so much more affecting in its original French than in English covers as “The Three Bells” or “Little Jimmy Brown” – and “La Complainte Du Roi Renaud”, a previously unreleased 1946 recording. A 15th century anti-war song, it demonstrates how Piaf and Les Compagnons could handle not just music hall material but also the complex polyphonies employed in medieval music. “Don’t think of tonight as a show,” croons Foy Vance at the start of this Union Chapel show. “Think of it more as watching a man fucking about with music.” Which, while giving some idea of his agreeably droll character, sets up exploratory expectations which his performance doesn’t quite bear out. Featuring his scorched sepia vocals accompanied by solo piano, guitar or ukulele, the tone becomes too repetitive across two CDs, with songs stretched by deep-soul inflections to the point that they drift free of melodies. An opening cover of Tom Petty’s “Free Fallin’” stands up well to Vance’s extemporisations; but it’s hard to imagine the more polished form of several new songs yet to feature on a studio album, other than to note the melodic echoes of “Desperado” and “Up The Junction” in “And So In Closing” and “London City” respectively. The latter, a more forgiving addendum to his dyspeptic “Closed Hand, Full Of Friends”, is perhaps the best of the new material, while the show’s overall highlight is the closing “The Wild Swans On The Lake”, which best capitalises on Vance’s impassioned delivery.

" The Offie-nominated playwright Sam Potter asks what family means in a modern society This one-woman show, engrossingly written by Sam Potter and beautifully performed by Sophie Khan Levy, pulls us into the experiences of a young mother who discovers that her three year old daughter is not hers genetically.  An alcoholic nurse had accidentally swapped her birth daughter, Ellie, with another newborn girl.  Hanna got pregnant by her “strong but silent”-type school pal, Pete, just before she was due to take up a place at university.  But she has never resented the shift of plan because she believes that motherhood has altered her life for the better more profoundly than a degree ever could.  So when Pete starts to accuse her of having been unfaithful – Ellie's complexion looks too dark to him – it's a terrible blow that the DNA test reveals that Ellie isn't hers either.  It forces Hanna to confront the question of what motherhood means.  Is the “real” mother always the birth mother?   Is it a bond made up of genes and blood or one created by care and devotion? The script and Khan Levy's portrayal have a lovely unforced naturalness.  Hannah is shy and conciliatory but charmingly honest and straight even while nervously signalling her awareness that trust can sometimes be misplaced and taken advantage of.  George Turvey's well-paced production is simply staged – just a chair, rug, jug of water and glass – in a way that seems to merge counselling session and chat show.  Not that she is out to claim any special status for herself. Hanna's discourse is constantly seeking to bridge our experience and hers: “Have you ever had that moment?...”.      Nature or nurture?  What is the force of class and ethnicity and income level on parenting? Hanna is inclined to blame herself when things go wrong and it only exacerbates this tendency when she meets the other family who are wealthy and mixed-race and she has to contrast her “little three-bed in Hemel” with their seven-bed mansion (“It was like being shown round the Cluedo board”).  She's young, working class, has little support and wouldn't know how to go about finding a lawyer, let alone sue the hospital for compensation as this other family are planning to do. Ought money to give a couple more clout in cases of mix-up like this? Potter writes with particular finesse and empathy about the conflicted feelings that are aroused in Hanna when the two little girls (who have been told nothing) start to have sleepovers at each other's houses.  She muses on her intense bond with Ellie, the one she raised, and her deep, regretful connection to Ayesha, the one she lost.  Ayesha has a wobbly patch at Ellie's place at the first of these and Hanna can't prevent herself crying along with her.  The child is weeping for her mum; Hanna is sobbing because she thinks that it is all her fault and that she has let this child down badly from the outset.  Bouncing on the bed lifts both their spirits, until Ayesha slips and has a bit of an accident. In general, the relationship seems to be going well, but there are intimations of unease.  My problem was not with the mounting panic, which is well sustained, but that the 70-minute play feels rushed and too positive in the way that it winds down from this peak. Nonetheless, well worth seeing.

" It was the speech of the night At the  , actress and media mogul Oprah became the first black woman to receive the Cecil B DeMille award. Actress and A Wrinkle In Time co-star Reese Witherspoon presented he 63-year-old icon with the honour, just after gushing about Winfrey's hugs and how much she's learned from her. Winfrey's impassioned speech covered everything from racism to #MeToo and even led to a standing ovation across the ceremony room. Thank you, Reese. In 1964, I was a little girl sitting on the linoleum floor of my mother's house in Milwaukee watching Anne Bancroft present the Oscar for best actor at the 36th Academy Awards. She opened the envelope and said five words that literally made history: The winner is Sidney Poitier. Up to the stage came the most elegant man I ever remembered. His tie was white, his skin was black—and he was being celebrated. I'd never seen a black man being celebrated like that. I tried many, many times to explain what a moment like that means to a little girl, a kid watching from the cheap seats as my mom came through the door bone tired from cleaning other people's houses. But all I can do is quote and say that the explanation in Sidney's performance in Lilies of the Field: Amen, amen, amen, amen.

DeMille award right here at the Golden Globes and it is not lost on me that at this moment, there are some little girls watching as I become the first black woman to be given this same award. It is an honor—it is an honor and it is a privilege to share the evening with all of them and also with the incredible men and women who have inspired me, who challenged me, who sustained me and made my journey to this stage possible. Dennis Swanson who took a chance on me for A.M. Chicago. Saw me on the show and said to Steven Spielberg, she's Sophia in 'The Color Purple.' Gayle who's been a friend and Stedman who's been my rock. I want to thank the Hollywood Foreign Press Association. We know the press is under siege these days. We also know it's the insatiable dedication to uncovering the absolute truth that keeps us from turning a blind eye to corruption and to injustice. To—to tyrants and victims, and secrets and lies. I want to say that I value the press more than ever before as we try to navigate these complicated times, which brings me to this: what I know for sure is that speaking your truth is the most powerful tool we all have. And I'm especially proud and inspired by all the women who have felt strong enough and empowered enough to speak up and share their personal stories. Each of us in this room are celebrated because of the stories that we tell, and this year we became the story. But it's not just a story affecting the entertainment industry. It's one that transcends any culture, geography, race, religion, politics, or workplace. So I want tonight to express gratitude to all the women who have endured years of abuse and assault because they, like my mother, had children to feed and bills to pay and dreams to pursue. They're the women whose names we'll never know. They are domestic workers and farm workers. They are working in factories and they work in restaurants and they're in academia, engineering, medicine, and science. They're part of the world of tech and politics and business. They're our athletes in the Olympics and they're our soldiers in the military. And there's someone else, Recy Taylor, a name I know and I think you should know, too. In 1944, Recy Taylor was a young wife and mother walking home from a church service she'd attended in Abbeville, Alabama, when she was abducted by six armed white men, raped, and left blindfolded by the side of the road coming home from church. They threatened to kill her if she ever told anyone, but her story was reported to the NAACP where a young worker by the name of Rosa Parks became the lead investigator on her case and together they sought justice. But justice wasn't an option in the era of Jim Crow. The men who tried to destroy her were never persecuted. Recy Taylor died ten days ago, just shy of her 98th birthday. She lived as we all have lived, too many years in a culture broken by brutally powerful men. For too long, women have not been heard or believed if they dare speak the truth to the power of those men. But their time is up. Their time is up. Their time is up. And I just hope—I just hope that Recy Taylor died knowing that her truth, like the truth of so many other women who were tormented in those years, and even now tormented, goes marching on. It was somewhere in Rosa Parks' heart almost 11 years later, when she made the decision to stay seated on that bus in Montgomery, and it's here with every woman who chooses to say, Me too. And every man—every man who chooses to listen. In my career, what I've always tried my best to do, whether on television or through film, is to say something about how men and women really behave. To say how we experience shame, how we love and how we rage, how we fail, how we retreat, persevere, and how we overcome. I've interviewed and portrayed people who've withstood some of the ugliest things life can throw at you, but the one quality all of them seem to share is an ability to maintain hope for a brighter morning, even during our darkest nights. So I want all the girls watching here, now, to know that a new day is on the horizon! And when that new day finally dawns, it will be because of a lot of magnificent women, many of whom are right here in this room tonight, and some pretty phenomenal men, fighting hard to make sure that they become the leaders who take us to the time when nobody ever has to say 'Me too' again.

" After the resounding success of her debut album  , Lorde took a step back and, in her own words, “wrote her way out of it”.  Disappearing from public view at the end of that album tour, she returns four years later to dispel any concerns about so-called “second album syndrome”. First single ‘Green Light’ was dubbed by producer Max Martin as “incorrect songwriting” when she showed it to him shortly before its release - yet it works - incredibly well. It's the best kind of break-up song, a snarling, energetic howl of anger and indignation: She thinks you love the beach, you're such a damned liar, Lorde sneers on the intro. Those non-rhymes and the key change that occurs just before the chorus jolts you out of a comfort zone you didn’t know you were in, like friends who drag you out to a bar after a relationship ends. “I’m waiting for it, that green light, I want it” she sings, as though asking when it’ll be time to feel OK again. There’s a dystopian feel that lingers on songs such as ‘Sober’, bolstered by those bold brass horns, then to ‘Dynamite’ - a Tove Lo co-write - sweeping the listener along in a heady rush of alcohol amid the romanticisation of dying young in a fast car. On ‘Hard Feelings - Loveless’ the clack on the beat seems haunted by her massive single ‘Royals’ before the tempo quickens and metallic bursts - these eery screeches - emerge in the instrumentation. On 'Writer in the Dark', a subtle standout on the album, Lorde's falsetto recalls Kate Bush or Freddie Mercury. was made mostly in New York with producer Jack Antonoff [fun., Bleachers] and the city plays a vital role on this record, encapsulating how you can feel both isolated in such a huge, crowded place but also embrace the anonymity that comes with it, and allow yourself to be drawn into the crowds. ‘Liability’, the second single off the record, was even more of a surprise than ‘Green Light’, but Lorde doesn’t try to pull any tricks on this one. Here she offers the bare bones of a song, nothing to hide behind, as she sings lyrics that are wryly self-aware with the tone of a person who’s too tired to fight anymore: “I understand - I’m a liability/Get too wild, make you leave/I’m a little much for everyone. ‘Supercut’, like ‘Green Light’, seems Robyn-inspired: this is unconventional pop that still bangs - Lorde’s off-kilter rhythms and quirks in the production expose the inner workings of her music, where other artists would demand their albums are buffed and polished into generic perfection. She respects pop for what it is and what it is capable of, how it can speak so bluntly of being alone yet simultaneously make you want to jump around the room.   documented feelings of teenage ennui in a way that was both self-reflective and universal; takes a similar approach to the early years of adulthood - following a narrative that could almost be one night at a house party - in all its gory detail. Fuelled by a black humour that’s almost become her trademark, there’s heartbreak and ecstasy, desire, fear, uncertainty, acting on impulse, making mistakes and (maybe) learning from them. And those are tunes we can definitely dance to.  We use cookies to enhance your visit to our site and to bring you advertisements that might interest you. Read our   and   Policies to find out more.

" This  It's amazing to think that a musical by Rodgers and Hammerstein can have had to wait nearly 70 years for the professional European premiere that it's now receiving from director Thom Southerland and his excellent team at London’s Southwark Playhouse.  (1947) was the duo's third show, hard on the heels of their ground-breaking hits   and  . But the experiments with form and content in the new piece met with mixed reviews and   had a run of only nine months – since when it has languished. The show, though, has its illustrious champions. Stephen Sondheim, who worked as a gopher on the original production, has praised it for being “the first commercial attempt to tell an epic story in popular music terms” and acknowledged its abiding influence on him: “I might not be quite so attracted to experimental musicals if I hadn't got my feet wet with .” The show follows an American Everyman –  Joe Taylor Jr, a small-town doctor– through the immemorial turning-points (first steps, first date, first bereavement, etc) to the moment of a mid-life crisis. By this stage, his over-ambitious wife has lured Joe from his happy provincial practice with his father to a job in a Big City hospital where he's expected to pamper the privileged. Will he be able return to his old ideals and put community before self?   The model is Thornton Wilder’s  , with the ambitious introduction of the musical equivalent of a Greek chorus, old-fashioned values and (what were then) innovative techniques; Southerland makes the interplay between these elements wonderfully captivating and affecting in his Southwark production.  At its centre, the splendid Gary Tushaw manages to radiate just the right degree of wholesome ordinariness with no leading-man vanities as Joe. The stripped-back traverse-staging, with the eloquent use of a pair of step-ladders and a mobile scaffold-tower, gives the proceedings the non-naturalist fluidity that the authors were seeking. Superbly performed in the narrow space by the 16-strong company, Lee Proud's high-precision choreography has an overwhelming dynamism  Perhaps the plot isn't strong enough to sustain a full-length show. Perhaps there are moments that are cloyingly sweet for modern tastes. It’s a mark, though, of the melodic largesse and variety of Richard Rodgers’s score that he can afford to give two of the best songs to cameo characters. Katie Bernstein as the loyal, lovelorn nurse really nails the rueful wit of “The Gentleman is a Dope”; Leah West gives a charming rendition of “So Far” as a college date who thinks, with tripping, misplaced hopefulness, that “now we can look forward to/The things we'll never forget”. The penultimate number, in which Joe's mother and the Chorus entreat him to “Come Home”, ranks with anything in the score for  ; Julie J Nagle and company deliver it with a quiet, aching poignancy. A lovely heartfelt production that takes you into the soul of a lost gem.

" Since Etsy was founded in 2005, it has benefited from putting people and community first Linda Kozlowski, the chief operating officer of online goods marketplace  , has just had lunch with some British sellers. “It’s a great opportunity to meet up with people and learn about their challenges, but somewhat bad for my wallet!” she laughs. Among today’s purchases: a leather necklace, two wallets – one for herself, one for a friend – and a rubber stamp for her Christmas cards.  Ms Kozlowski, who works out of Etsy’s head office in New York, is visiting the UK to talk to sellers about some new initiatives intended to make their lives easier, including gift-wrapping options and improved transparency about deliveries. The 44-year old has been in charge of operations at Etsy since May 2016. She joined from Evernote, a note-taking app, where she managed global operations, which followed a four-year stint in Hong Kong working for e-retail giant Alibaba, where she was in charge of global marketing and business development. She is also a recovering journalist. “I’ve always been attracted to platforms that support entrepreneurship,” she says. “Alibaba was so big, it was on a different scale. Evernote was a place to support creatives, but Etsy is the ultimate for me: when you have the creative entrepreneur and the businesses side coming together.” Since Etsy was founded in 2005, it has benefited from putting people and community first, in opposition to the more jumble-sale approach of the likes of eBay and Amazon. Etsy gained a reputation for supporting  after it was revealed that 86 per cent of its sellers are female.  The site also became known for its wacky but lovable products, ranging from beautiful hand-illustrated Christmas cards to chicken ponchos and  .  As sales grew, Etsy broadened its horizons by introducing a wholesale business for bulk sales in 2014 and, in February of this year, a studio that sells craft supplies. But expansion came at the expense of key areas of the business. Other online retailers have become more sophisticated, offering curated search results and personalised products. And competition also picked up when Amazon launched its own Handmade marketplace in 2015, going head-to-head with Etsy.  After a slowdown in transactions and an unexpected loss in the first quarter of 2017, Etsy needed a shakeup. It got one in May with new chief executive Josh Silverman, a board member at restaurant chain Shake Shack and ScriptEd, a coding course for schools.  Mr Silverman immediately cut 140 jobs, bringing the total jobs lost to 230 since the beginning of the year. He also brought the focus back to what Etsy calls its “core business”: helping homegrown entrepreneurs sell their goods more quickly. Ms Kozlowski says Josh Silverman has been responsible for two changes. “Focus, which Josh has talked a lot about: narrowing down and making sure we’re doing the best things for our community, which includes a focus on how we grow sales for our sellers. The second offshoot of that is being fast with how we test ways to do it.” Results for the third quarter of 2017 were much improved. Sales grew 13 per cent while revenue was $106.4m (£80m), beating the average analyst estimate of $104.9m.  ⏲️ Etsy Made Local launches 1 month today. Enjoy    :    🎄🎁  The company is now testing ways to improve its search function. Etsy users sometimes complain of items showing up more than once during a search, while commercially produced goods have infiltrated results. Ms Kozlowski says the acquisition of a company called Blackbird Technologies in 2016 has helped the group employ artificial intelligence to personalise search results, so buyers see the items most relevant to them.  They are also experimenting with eBay-like functions that allow buyers to see how many of an item are left and how many people have so far looked at it, to gauge how popular it is. Etsy is trialling new ways to make delivery more transparent, such as tracking numbers to give buyers and sellers an update on the shipping process. For the Christmas season – typically Etsy’s busiest time of year – it has added an gift-wrap option and a packing slip. The company is also experimenting with a social media tool that posts across Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and Pinterest from within the Etsy app, to save sellers time. The tool allows sellers to create promotional posts if they are running a sale, or turn posts into paid-for Facebook adverts. This focus extends to Etsy’s geographical reach. Etsy is looking to expand its base of 150,000 sellers in Britain. The UK is one of the company’s top six markets, but Ms Kozlowski is tight-lipped when I ask her which countries make up the other five: “We’re going to focus on our six core markets and not necessarily expand into other markets, even though we have buyers and sellers all over the world.” Ms Kozlowski’s interest in craft stems from her mother, who sold homemade crafts as a side project during her daughter’s childhood in North Carolina. Ms Kozlowski’s mother started making and painting aluminium flowers as a hobby, but when she when she ran out of places to keep them she started selling them to people she knew.  “There is only so much you can keep in your own home, so it’s a great way to create what you love and share that with people in the world,” she says. “We have some sellers who are doing exactly that, making something on the side, but then we have a lot of sellers who started doing this as a hobby and discovered it could be a business.” Ms Kozlowski sees her job as making the Etsy experience consistent from the seller to the buyer, so that buyers get what she calls a “a spark of joy” from buying something handmade and being in touch with its creator.    This year, the company has increased the number of pop-up Christmas markets taking place across the country under the name Made Local. The idea is an extension of Etsy itself: “E We use cookies to enhance your visit to our site and to bring you advertisements that might interest you. Read our   and   Policies to find out more.

" This intimately staged production by Geoffrey Beevers marks the 150th anniversary of the author’s birth Best known for the television adaptations of his novel sequence,  , John Galsworthy was also a prolific dramatist who was spoken of, in his day, in the same breath as Shaw and Granville Barker. Sporadic revivals of his plays demonstrate the reformist fervour and skilful scrupulosity with which he tackled social issues – industrial unrest in  1909), war hysteria and pacifism in   (1914) and caste-bound racial prejudice in  (1922).   another play from 1922, is now given its first professional revival for 85 years in this attractively acted and intimately staged production by Geoffrey Beevers which marks the 150th anniversary of the author’s birth. Described by Galsworthy as “a comedy for idealists and others”, the piece is set in the aftermath of the First World War as the English struggle to come to terms with an altered world and the betrayal of the values for which they fought. Geoffrey March (David Shelley) is a well-to-do, liberal-minded novel-writer and journalist who enjoys expostulating at the government and exchanging thoughts about the new moral uncertainties with his son Johnny (Duncan Moore), who has emerged from three years in the trenches fiercely clinging to the idea of chivalry, and with his window-cleaner, Bly, (Vincent Brimble), an amateur philosopher who knows his Nietzsche from his Hegel and considers that that the right course in life is to follow your instincts.   March’s high-mindedness is put to the test when Bly suggests that the family employ his daughter as their parlour maid. Faith is a young woman who does not come with glowing references. She’s just out of prison, where she’s served a three-year sentence, having narrowly avoided the death penalty for smothering her new-born illegitimate baby. All his liberal inclinations prompt March to give Faith a fresh start; his chillier, pragmatic wife (“For a man who can’t see an inch into human nature, give me a  – psychological novelist!”) is vehemently opposed to the plan.  The play is marred by some heavy-duty imagery about windows courtesy of the Cockney cleaner (who sounds like a bookworm cousin of Alfred Doolittle). This over-insists on the theme of needing to see people accurately, undistorted by crusading do-goodism or purblind social prejudice.  Faith is neither a “minx”, as she’s characterised by the reproving Mrs March (spot-on Carolyn Backhouse) nor a “cause” that Johnny can save himself by championing. Charlotte Brimble’s splendid performance shows you how the beautiful Faith eludes simple categorisation. Anxious to make up for lost time, she has an air of mutiny about her, is in no mood for gratitude, and soon starts making eyes at the susceptible Johnny. But she also gives you moving glimpses of the girl’s aching, heartfelt regret, driven to a moment’s aberration by desperate fears about her baby’s future. Faith’s calculation, that at first looks compulsive, is largely, you feel, the product of an insecurity that the experience of prison has only deepened. Her father may be pessimistic about people’s capacity for change: “It’s ’ardly worthwhile to do these winders. You clean ’em and they’re dirty again in no time... And people talk o’ progress.” Windows, by contrast, suggests that vicious circles can be broken, if only reformers will pay the right kind of attention. The dialogue has a fair share of sprightly wit and there are eloquent passages, such as the one in which Faith and Johnny compare the respective hells (prison and the trenches) that they have just survived. The satire on blinkered philanthropy isn’t always well-integrated, though, with the play’s concern about this young woman’s dangerous predicament, and there is not an ironic enough edge in this production to the climax which gives the spotlight to the middle-classes congratulating themselves on their last-minute enlightenment as they walk through the windows into the air.

" The American playwright Christopher Chen's play commemorates the 80th anniversary of the Nanking massacre   It’s the 80th anniversary of the Nanking massacre, one of the most heinous atrocities of the twentieth century.  Starting in December 1937 and extending over six weeks, the Japanese Imperial Army subjected the inhabitants of Nanking, then China’s capital city, to unspeakable savagery and carnage – the rape, torture, and murder in killing competitions of 300,000 civilians and the systematic mass execution of soldiers.  Into the Numbers, by the Obie-winning American playwright Christopher Chen, is not a straightforward commemoration. Its central focus is on Iris Chang, author of the 1997 book, The Rape of Nanking: The Forgotten Holocaust of World War II, which became an international best seller and established her as a vociferous advocate for victims of Japanese war crimes. She committed suicide in 2004 at the age of 36. The piece takes the format of a typical lecture/interview/Q and A session that then starts to spiral into something more surreal. The interviewer (Timothy Knightley) morphs into her husband and her doctor seems to wonder about the wisdom of “devoting [her] life to exposing the worst in people”.  There’s no end, he argues, to the injustices she could uncover. Tireless and terribly tired, Elizabeth Chan cuts an intense, earnest, totally uncynical or sentimentalised figure in Georgie Staight’s absorbing production.  The production is adept at negotiating the tricky range of tones in the play – from the black comedy of the interview with Mark Ota’s deputy Japanese ambassador (whose twisted refusal to make an official apology blithely abolishes the notion of free will and accountability) to the spellbinding encounter in which Iris begs to know why Minnie Vautrin (Amy Molloy), an American missionary and heroine of the Safety Zone, committed suicide after her return to America in 1940.  “Weaker people who saw these things survived.” “I saw the Devil eat God alive” recounts Minnie, in a hair-raising sequence that makes you wonder whether Chen has based this on journal entries by the missionary and rather hope, for her sake, that he has imagined it. In the end, Into the Numbers celebrates a writer who, for the best of reasons, thought that we must stare difficult facts in the face if we are ever to move forward as human beings but who was rendered too vulnerable and exhausted by her bipolar illness to set up a psychic defence against despair. There’s a heartbreaking moment when her husband praises her for not sleepwalking through life and she replies: “Sleepwalkers know something I don’t know. The value of ignorance”. It is not meant as a back-handed compliment to say that this concise, impressionistic work leaves one wanting to discover more about both the Massacre and Iris Chang.  We use cookies to enhance your visit to our site and to bring you advertisements that might interest you.

" Lingerie Outlet Store is one a growing number of million-pound eBay businesses in the UK, with the number having risen by 50 per cent since 2013 It’s happened to the best of us. The clothes are off, it’s time to get down to business. Then it all comes pouring out. Working in a lingerie shop, it was an occupational hazard for   Clare Haines. “I love customers,” she says. “But often they feel like they have to tell you their life story just because they have taken their clothes off.” Haines briefly flirted with bricks and mortar after launching Lingerie Outlet Store in 2009 on   from her garage in  . But the naked customers proved too much to handle and she quickly switched back to selling exclusively through the online platform. “It’s just more efficient. With online customer service, they only tell you what you need to know,” she says. Haines is one of a growing number of eBay millionaires in the   - defined as a business registered on eBay.co.uk with a turnover of £1m or more. The number has risen by 50 per cent since 2013, from 443 to 663. Her business has ridden the wave of booming fashion sales on the online marketplace, jumping from sales of £51,000 in their first year to a projected £8m by the end of 2017.   For someone who claims not to know the meaning of ‘profit margin’, eBay’s user friendly platform was an ideal starting place. “When I started the business eight years ago eBay was the only place I could sell the product online and get instant, transparent feedback from customers,” she says. “I didn’t have the confidence to start with a bricks and mortar store. The great thing about starting on eBay is that I learnt as I went.” With a background in advertising and little business acumen, Haines kept the business chugging along but found herself hitting a growth ceiling without knowing why. In 2015 her best friend Melissa Burton joined the business as an equal partner, bringing with her 20 years of wisdom from working in blue chip companies and telecoms. Since then, the firm has grown by 2,000 per cent. Haines credits Burton with turning the company into “a grown-up business”, with spreadsheets, cashflows, and “other things that make me go ‘aaaah’.” Burton says Haines “could sell ice to an eskimo”, and the pair’s skills sets complement each other perfectly. But even with the business now established and Burton’s expertise on board, they feel no desire to expand away from eBay. “eBay has world class marketing and advertising built in as part of its service, so you don’t need to delve into the bottomless pit that is   ads,” says Burton. “Consumers feel their data is protected but they also know exactly what they are getting because of the customer reviews.” Richard Cousins, CEO of catering giant Compass group, died alongside four family members in a seaplane crash in Australia on New Year's Eve. The  killed six people near Cowan, north of Sydney. Mr Cousins had led Compass for just over a decade and was due to step down at the end of March this year. Cheltenham, famous for horse racing, recorded the highest percentage rise in house price of any major UK town or city last year. House price growth has slowed this year, with London a particular weak spot, thanks to a sluggish economy and a squeeze on consumers in the wake of the vote to leave the European Union. PA Wire/PA Images More commuter pain as average rail ticket prices have risen by 3.4 per cent across the UK. Some commuters could see tickets go up by more than £100. The Department for Transport said price rises were capped in line with inflation.  PA The Co-op plans to open 100 new food stores across the UK this year, creating an estimated 1,600 jobs.
The retailer on Tuesday said that it plans to spend more than £160m on the new stores, as well as on major makeovers for a further 150 of its existing outlets. Car giant Vauxhall has slipped to third place in UK sales rankings. The brand has been overtaken by scandal-hit Volkswagen in new car registrations, recording a 22 per cent year-on-year decrease in the first 11 months of 2017. PA Wire/PA Images The pair cite the “explosion” of stores like Victoria’s Secret as the engine behind the continued expansion of the lingerie market, but they have a secret weapon of their own: motherhood. Haines is a single parent, who juggles running her own business with raising her 14-year-old son, who she describes as a “proper teenager”, while Burton’s baby boy is now 21. The pair admit it’s been far from easy, but being in control of their own time means they no longer have to work weekends or evenings. “Being a working mum gives you the tenacity you need to make it as an entrepreneur,” says Burton. “It’s that phone call at 9am telling you there’s no packed lunch and you’ve got to go and find a solution. It teaches you adaptability and time-management.  “If there’s a problem at work we’re like, ‘we’re working mums, it’s fine, we can sort this’.” It’s also made the pair “wildly competitive” and given them an inner belief that anything is possible. They say that yesterday was their biggest sales day yet. “That’s something we find ourselves saying every week,” says Burton. “If that continues it won’t be long before our annual sales hit £16m plus.” We use cookies to enhance your visit to our site and to bring you advertisements that might interest you.

" Women are being inspired to become online entrepreneurs by Etsy, the marketplace whose sellers are 86% female, almost half with children Louise Verity had always loved making things by hand. From the age of 11 she created stickers made of wrapping paper. At university she made tote bags to sell in local boutiques. Her craft work took a back seat when she started full-time work until she came across  , the online marketplace, in 2009. Through her Etsy store  , Verity started selling framed pages from books hand-inked with quotes from William Morris, Peter Pan and Oscar Wilde. It wasn’t until the birth of her first child that Verity realised Etsy could be more than a hobby. “When I went on maternity leave with our eldest in 2011, I had a go at taking the business a bit more seriously. My Etsy sales grew,” she says. She found a few other sales avenues. When it was time to go back to work after maternity leave, Verity was doing so well that she decided to stay self-employed.  Soon, Verity started paying people to pack orders. She now has a team of 12 including designers, admin staff and a marketing graduate. Eight years on, the framed prints that started the business are still an integral part of the brand, but sales are driven by a number of other products, including monthly book club subscriptions and personalised star-chart prints. “I worked out a little while ago that if it was still just me and my current level of Etsy sales, I would be earning more that I ever did in normal employment,” she says. Etsy sellers don’t conform to normal stereotypes of entrepreneurs in several ways. Many are considered micro-businesses because they have fewer than 10 employees. Nearly half of these micro-businesses are first-time entrepreneurs. Almost a third live far away from Silicon roundabout in rural communities. Most of all, a huge majority of Etsy sellers are female. According to Etsy’s 2017 seller census, 86 per cent of Etsy sellers in the UK are women and nearly half have children at home. This is a reverse of the national picture. According to the Department for Business, Innovation & Skills’ last study in 2014, 20 per cent of single-operator businesses were owned and run by women.  “We’re really excited about that because it’s an atypical view of an entrepreneur,” says Annette Picardo, UK managing director of Etsy. She says Etsy appeals to women for three key reasons.  First, 63 per cent of Etsy sellers built their business as a creative outlet. These entrepreneurs are very different from the stereotype of the man with his startup on London’s “ ”, plugging the latest app or software development and dreaming of becoming the next  . Emma Alford used to be a project manager for a privately owned illustration agency. She worked with high-profile, international clients on illustrations for their publications and media projects. Complications during pregnancy meant that Alford had to end her contract early. Once she had a baby, rather than go back to work she decided to manage her time around her motherhood. Alford says her brand,  , was “created out of need to do something challenging again – an outlet that echoed my love for ceramics and clay work.” Although Alford opened her Etsy shop in 2014, she didn’t start selling until early 2015 and at first tested the marketplace with small, easy-to-make items. Over time she found that business was better when she embraced her creativity and made larger pieces that weren’t available elsewhere. “The market for smaller clay items is fairly well supported so I gradually moved into larger pieces that reflected my personality and style,” she says. “Now my new pieces, which I have been selling for nearly two years, are well-received and I often have custom requests, commissions and waiting lists for my items, which is nice.” Alford says selling on Etsy has relieved some of the financial pressure on her family. But more than the financial benefits, she has felt supported by a community of sellers in forums, called “ ”, and on social media.  “There is a significant amount of support for sellers and I think this that has allowed so many work-from-home mothers, young crafters and entrepreneurs to share their work without feeling pressured to succeed and meet corporate targets,” she says. Etsy’s Annette Picardo says the the sense of community is the second key reason for Etsy’s appeal to women. The site has over 1,000 community groups across the UK, with many meeting up offline and in person. “It’s this social interaction that when you’re working in an office you take for granted,” she says. “Many of our sellers work alone and crave that support.” Picardo adds the flexibility to run a business around other commitments is attractive, especially to women with children. The number of women in self-employment has risen by approximately 40 per cent since the 2008 recession, compared to just 13 per cent for men 358,000 in that time, according to the Federation of Small Businesses. A quarter of self-employed women surveyed by the FSB said that they decided to start their own business for the flexibility, which allows them to be more involved in childcare and family life.  Rachel Jinks says flexibility is a huge draw for mothers. After she had a baby in 2014, the income from her Etsy shop  , which sells cats collars, meant that she could afford a longer maternity leave. She now balances the Etsy shop with motherhood and a part-time job.  “Etsy allows you to spend a little time each day or each week dealing with the retail side around other commitments you may have,” she says The rise in self-employment is not without risks. Unlike traditional employees, Etsy sellers and other independent sellers do not have the same access to safety nets like sick pay and parental leave. Flexibility can come with instability.  Etsy has an advocacy team that focuses on informing sellers about policies on economic security for the self-employed. “We want our sellers to be part of the conversation when we’re talking about taking risks. How can they look at their income volatility, pensions, that kind of thing,” says Picardo.  Despite the risks associated with self-employment, adds BookishlyUK’s Louise Verity, Etsy gives women more choice. “Women are still more likely to give up their jobs after having children than men but places like Etsy give them the starting point to work around their children. And it’s not just about income – the community and online colleagues are a really important part of it too,” she says.

" MPs say the Government has ‘sat on its hands’ as the country throws away 2.5 billion disposable coffee cups a year MPs have today called for drastic action to tackle the UK’s mountain of unrecycled  , demanding a new 25p tax on every one used. The members of an influential Commons committee hit out at big-name coffee chains for failing to act on the growing problem and said if all cups are not recycled within five years an outright ban should be placed on them. In a report published on Friday, they said the Government had “sat on its hands” as the country has proceeded to  . Introducing a 25p “ ” on top of the price of a drink - a move backed by   - would pay to improve the UK’s reprocessing facilities and “binfastructure” and ultimately change people’s behaviour, said Mary Creagh, chair of the Environmental Audit Committee.  The Government has recently taken action to tackle   bags and is also under pressure to act more widely on non-recyclable plastics. But with the UK’s burgeoning coffee shop culture, attention has now turned to the growing problem of difficult-to-recycle cups littering the streets and clogging up the waste-disposal systems. Some shops already give money off the price of a hot drink for customers who use reusable cups, such as Pret A Manger,  . And Starbucks has said the company will start a three-month trail next month of 5p charge for disposable cups in up to 25 London stores, adding that its trial of a 50p discount for customers using reusable cups in 2016 “did not move the needle in the way we thought it might”. Just 1.8 per cent of its customers currently use recyclable cups.  Last year   by up to 300 million a year. Ms Creagh said: “Coffee shops have been pulling the wool over customers’ eyes, telling us their cups can be recycled, when less than 1 per cent are. “The Government should set a target of all disposable coffee cups to be recycled by 2023. If a sustainable recycling system for disposable coffee cups cannot be set up by this date, they should be banned.”  She added that coffee cup producers and distributors have not taken action to rectify the scale of waste and claimed the Government “has sat on its hands”.  Journalist Carrie Gracie speaks to the media outside the BBC in London after she turned down a £45,000 rise, describing the offer as a botched solution to the problem of unequal pay at the BBC.

We’re calling for action to reduce the number of single-use cups, promote reusable cups over disposable cups and to recycle all coffee cups by 2023.”  Laura Foster, the head of clean seas at the Marine Conservation Society, said the charge would be similar to plastic bag charge introduced in 2015 and would “help consumers think about whether to take a refill cup to the café”.  In 2016, figures showed the number of single-use plastic bags used by consumers in England dropped by more than 85 per cent in the first year of the ban.  Ms Foster added: “We totally agree with the committee that if 100 per cent recycling of coffee cups isn’t reached by 2023, then there should be an outright ban on providing them – and that date should be set in stone.  “Only by treating this issue as one that is the responsibility of both industry and consumers will re-use become the norm in place of single-use and throw away.”  Greenpeace UK oceans campaigner Fiona Nicholls said the country needs to make sure it recycles all the plastic it produces, or risk making millions of tonnes of pollution, which ends up in the food chain.  “Non-recyclable plastic products from polystyrene, PVC or mixed materials need to be phased out, and quickly,” she said. “We need to reduce plastic packaging wherever we can, which in this case means replacing disposable cups with reusable cups, and encouraging business and consumers to use them.” She added: “This is a big problem which is getting bigger all the time … we must not allow the packaging industry to water down these recommendations any further.”  Celebrity chef Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall branded the problem “horrendous” and saying it needs “urgent action”. Environmental charity Hubbub said it was “disappointed” that the industry had not used lessons from two successful cup recycling campaigns – one in London which recycled more than four million cups since its launch in April 2017 and another in Manchester which recycled almost 30,000 cups from one street alone – to achieve a wider impact. A spokesperson said: “We welcome this report and hope it will stimulate the industry to do more.” A spokesperson for the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) said the Government “will closely consider the committee’s recommendations and respond shortly”.  They added: “We are encouraged by industry action to increase the recycling of paper cups with some major retail chains now offering discounts to customers with reusable cups.” 1.

" As the UK moves towards action on non-recyclable beverage containers, other countries are taking steps in the same direction MPs on the Environmental Audit Committee have recommended the Government   in the form of a 25p charge on disposable coffee cups bought by customers. The recommendation formed part of a larger report laying out the environmental issues associated with these cups, and potential strategies for dealing with them. Recycling disposable coffee cups – which are lined with non-biodegradable plastic – is   as there are only three centres equipped to deal with them. If all coffee cups are not made recyclable by 2023, the committee concluded that disposable coffee cups should be banned altogether. The UK is moving towards action on the 2.5 billion coffee cups it gets through every year, and other European countries have already begun to take tentative steps in the same direction. Talk of a similar latte levy being applied in Ireland began around the end of 2017. The addition of about 10p to the price of a takeaway coffee is being considered as part of a selection of incentives to cut down on the use of disposable coffee cups and  . “As a society we discard an incredible 80 per cent of what we produce after a single use,” Irish environment secretary Denis Naughten told  .

The Irish government is investigating the possibility of a nationwide scheme where customers could sign up in order to return their reusable cup to participating cafes. In Roscommon, part of the environment minister’s own constituency, the ‘Rossie’ reusable cup has been launched as a pilot project, with cafes giving discounts to customers who use them. “There is enormous potential for a nationwide scheme involving local authorities, businesses and cafe owners,” said Mr Naughten. The Irish Green Party wants to go one step further, proposing as part of its waste reduction bill that an outright ban should be introduced on non-recyclable beverage containers in Ireland. However, Mr Naughten noted that levying or banning items within the EU are complex processes. “While I can fully appreciate the good intentions behind this proposal, as minister I also have a responsibility to ensure any such prohibition, if introduced, would not be in breach of the free movement provisions of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,” said Mr Naughten. An Irish government spokesman told   that Mr Naughten intends to undertake a “research and consultation process” this year to explore future directions for waste management. In 2016, France made headlines when it passed a law “banning” disposable cups, cutlery and plates. The law, set to come into effect in 2020, will mean disposable items must be made from at least 50 per cent biologically-sourced materials that are compostable at home. Most disposable coffee cups are currently non-biodegradable, and must be take away to specialised facilities in order to be recycled, only three of which exist in the UK. The move is part of the Energy Transition for Green Growth – a French plan aimed at tackling climate change. Environmental organisations and some politicians welcomed the ban, with municipal councillor and food waste campaigner Arash Derambarsh calling for it to be extended across Europe. “This problem of recycling exists in all European countries,”  . “We have to pass the same law in all European countries to tackle this very important problem of waste.” However, there were concerns that this too would violate European Union rules about free movement of goods, with packaging association Pack2Go Europe stating it would fight the new legislation. “We are urging the European Commission to do the right thing and to take legal action against France for infringing European law,” said Pack2go Europe secretary general Eamonn Bates. “If they don’t, we will.” According to the German Environmental Aid forum, in Germany the coffee cup problem exceeds that of the UK, with almost three billion disposable cups used every year. In an effort to combat this problem, several local councils across the country have introduced their own reusable cups. The “Freiburg Cup” has been introduced in around 80 venues across the German state of Baden-Württemberg. These cups are designed for long-term use, with a suggested lifespan of 400 uses. Cups are provided by councils, and cafes are responsible for distributing and washing them. They can be obtained from participating venues for a deposit of one euro. Similar experiments have also taken place in the cities of Berlin, Tübingen and Rosenheim. Although nowhere in Germany has gone as far as banning disposable coffee cups yet, in 2016 Hamburg became the first city to   from government-run buildings.

" Taxpayers foot the bill for processing 90 per cent of packaging waste Leading high street coffee chains have been urged to come clean about the amount of plastic waste they produce after they refused to release details about the number of throwaway cups sold in their shops.   Campaigners said the UK was in the midst of a “coffee cup nightmare” and urged major retailers to be “upfront” about the environmental damage they were doing amid a renewed focus on disposable cups.  The UK throws away 2.5 billion paper coffee cups every year, with just one in 400 estimated to be recycled. The majority of those are sold by high street coffee chains, yet taxpayers foot the bill for processing 90 per cent of packaging waste. Coffee cups are particularly hard to recycle because they contain a paper exterior with a plastic lining to keep the cup sealed.  As a result, almost all of them are incinerated, exported or sent to landfill. Asked by   how many disposable cups were handed out to customers every day in their UK shops, several of the country’s largest chains were unable to provide the figure. Those that were able to only did so after repeated requests for the information. That response prompted environmental groups to warn of a lack of transparency among high street coffee vendors.  The issue of coffee cup waste was highlighted last week by a group of MPs who urged the Government to introduce a 25p charge for disposable cups on top of the price of a coffee. Some shops give money off the price of a hot drink for customers who use reusable cups, but the committee said uptake of these offers was low at only 1 per cent to 2 per cent of coffee purchases. Costa, the country’s largest coffee shop chain with more than 2,000 cafés, said it was unable to provide the latest figures for the number of takeaway cups used because it was in a “closed trading period”.  Pressed to give an estimate, it referred   to a submission to the   from last April that showed it sold 76 million throwaway paper cups each year.  , the UK’s second biggest coffee chain, said it was aware of the problem and was trialling a 5p charge for throwaway cups in a selection of its London shops – but failed to provide a figure. Marks & Spencer was also unable to provide the data, but said just 3 per cent of all its hot drinks were sold in throwaway cups.  A spokeswoman for Pret a Manger, which recently introduced a 50p discount for coffee drinkers who bring their own mug, said she was unable to provide a figure but acknowledged it was likely to be a “big number”. Julian Kirby, Friends of the Earth waste campaigner, said coffee chains must be “upfront and honest about their contributions to the problem, which means disclosing the amount of single-use coffee cups that they are releasing onto our streets every day”. He told  : “The last thing these companies want is to confirm what we all know, which is that every day they generate a colossal amount of plastic pollution.”  said it got through 100,000 takeaway cups each day, but when asked how many the chain recycled, a spokeswoman said the “vast majority of the cups and lids we issue leave the store and are disposed of away from the original point of purchase”. Sandwich chain Eat said it was unable to provide the figures on cups used, but added that it used compostable cups and was working with a supplier to provide compostable or recyclable lids. , which offers free coffee in its supermarkets for holders of its loyalty card, said it was an “industry-wide issue” and suggested enquiries be forwarded to the British Retail Consortium. Fiona Nicholls, oceans campaigner at  , said tackling the problem of plastic waste required “transparency and cooperation from business”. “Taxpayers are paying to clear up a mess made by manufacturers and retailers, with just 10 per cent of the bill for disposing of packaging waste paid by business, and that needs to change,” she said.  , chef and environmental campaigner, said the UK was in the midst of a “coffee cup nightmare”. He said: “It’s time to send these hugely profitable companies a clear message: stop making badly designed products and expecting the taxpayer to clean up after you.” We use cookies to enhance your visit to our site and to bring you advertisements that might interest you.

" From herbal infusions to oolong tea, bring out the best flavours in your favourite hot drinks An electric water kettle is a must-have for any kitchen, but if you’re an avid tea or coffee drinker, you’re much better off getting one which boils at different temperatures to bring out the best flavours. Green and white teas, for example, are best made with water at about 70°C, while black and oolong teas need water around 85°C. For herbal infusions, you’re looking at 100°C, and for chamomile, around 90°C. Meanwhile, the optimum temperature for coffee is between 91°C and 96°C. Boiling water will in fact burn the coffee.  Don’t be fooled by looks alone. We tested one of the most expensive so-called “intelligent kettles”, but aesthetics were pretty much all it had going for it. It was slow to boil, didn’t automatically switch off when boiled and the limescale filter was poor. It was a nightmare to keep clean and it was uncomfortable to hold.  Other questions to consider are: does it have all the temperature settings you need? How noisy is it? Is it energy efficient, allowing you to boil just one or two cups at a time? How easy is it to use? Can you see the water levels? Is it sturdy and durable? 1.   £46.89, Argos Available in black or white, this kettle is really quick to boil, yet boasts great energy efficiency, allowing you to heat as little as one cup’s worth at a time. It’s got four settings from 70-100°C and will keep the water at that temperature for 30 minutes. It’s easy to fill and has one of the best limescale filters we came across. But it’s quite noisy. 2.   £59.99, Amazon This eye-catching kettle is intuitive and practical, with a particularly good pouring action. The temperature options range from 50-100°C, in 10-degree intervals, and it will keep water warm for 30 minutes. We like the fact that you can see as the temperature builds and drops on the LED display, and although it marks quite easily, it’s not hard to clean. 3.   £89.99, Lakeland  This Australian-made, Heston Blumenthal-endorsed kettle is another fast boiler and we like the clear windows that save you squinting to see how much water there is. There are four settings from 80-100°C, plus a 20-minute keep-warm button. It’s easy to lift, but it’s not great for hard water areas as it’s got a poor limescale filter. 4.   £85, Cuisinart  This is quick and easy to use, with an ergonomic handle and clear temperature buttons that heat water to either 85°C (for speciality teas and instant coffee) or 100°C (for ordinary black tea). Fear not if you want more choice, however, as a third button allows you to vary the temperature between these ones in 5°C increments. There’s a good limescale filter and a great matching toaster, but it’s tricky to clean and it’s loud. 5.  £31.99, Domu This great value kettle has an impressive six settings from 40-100°C, along with keep-warm options that last up to half-an hour. It’s easy to see how much water there is and there is a swivel base, but it is prone to limescale build up and it’s noisier and slower than others in this round-up. 6.   £99.99, Lakeland This app-controlled kettle, with temperature ranges from 20-100°C, puts an end to irritating bleeps and whistles by quietly alerting you via your smartphone or tablet when the water has reached the desired temperature. Connect it to your wi-fi to boil it remotely, or set the wake-up mode for that morning cuppa. We also like the water sensors, which send a reminder if there isn’t enough in the kettle, and it speaks different languages, too. 7.   £54.34, Amazon This is a good price for a kettle with different temperature options – in this case, 70°C, 80°C or 90°C, which are great for making drinks such as green tea and coffee. It boils fast and is simple to lift and fill up. But it’s hard to see the water level very clearly and it builds up with limescale in hard water areas. 8.   £129.95, John Lewis   This stylish kettle is available in a range of metallic colours with chrome finishing. It’s simple to use and can boil a single cup at a time, which is good news for keeping electricity costs low, as well as saving time. There are five temperature settings – 75°C, 80°C, 85°C and 90°C – and a keep-warm function that works for 20 minutes. And there’s a matching toaster if you want to complete the look. The handle isn’t as comfortable as others, though. The only fault we could find with the   were the noise levels – and it’s particularly good if you live in a hard water area.

" Get your plates squeaky clean and your glasses sparkling with an efficient machine Hands up – who feels like they spend their lives loading and unloading the dishwasher? With our help, you can find the right dishwasher for you and bring a bit of sparkle back into the kitchen. When looking for the right model, consider your space and what you want on show. Standard dishwashers will take the 600mm-wide space of the average kitchen unit, which will tackle an average of 12 place settings. You may want to integrate the machine into your existing kitchen look, so check with your kitchen manufacturer if there’s a matching door available to affix to an integral model. Go slimline if you have only 450mm to spare or consider a table-top version if space is really limited.    With features such as wifi connectivity, height-adjustable shelves and baskets and sensors to gauge if water is clean enough to recycle for another rinse, there is a lot more to it than soap and water. The energy ratings for models here range from ultra-eco A+++ (Miele) to A (Indesit) and so can all be classed as energy-efficient in terms of cost to run as other new models can score all the way through to a D rating. Eco wash programmes will help save money, too. Although they take longer (typically about three hours) they use cooler water to get results. The decibel reading will also appear on the ratings label, so do consider the noise your dishwasher will make, especially if you are living in an open-plan space. We put a range of machines to the test to find the “best in class” for different size and space needs.    We used this quiet (43db) dishwasher in an open-plan living space and TV viewing was uninterrupted. One of the main benefits of choosing this quiet model is its eco credentials. It has a super-efficient A++ consumption rating and uses only six litres of water per cycle (some use up to 16), so it is a fantastic choice if you are on a water meter. The additional spraying arm on the bottom of the machine helps lift even the most baked-on debris and dried cereal on breakfast bowls. Great value for money. You will also find slimline and integrated models in the EcoSmart range. At only 45cm wide you may be able to slide this slim dishwasher into the smallest of kitchens. The only stainless steel model we looked at, it had a sleek and neat interior that could fit a surprisingly impressive amount of dirty dishes (up to 10 place settings) thanks to the height adjustment on the baskets and the glass supports, which could be folded or moved completely to accommodate larger pans if need be. At just 25 minutes, the shortest cycle left red wine glasses sparkling. This is very easy to use as the top basket will move downwards to accommodate long stemware or bulky dishes. The side racks can also be flipped to maximise space. If you are in a hurry, use the boosted VarioSpeed function which gives the usual cleaning results in about half the time of a normal cycle. The eco cycle does take a lengthy three and a half hours, however, but if it is washing overnight then that shouldn’t be a problem. It will switch itself off at the end of the cycle, too. A quality, versatile model at a great price. Samsung’s WaterWall system means that water spray moves in a line back and forth on the base of this dishwasher, rather than dispersing it in a circular motion as in most other models. The benefit? Higher water pressure means more efficient cleaning – we found dried-on egg was shifted from breakfast plates on a short setting. Every rack can be folded flat on the bottom tray, so we managed to give even bulky oven trays the once-over. The top FlexTray (a rubber cutlery insert for the upper rack) inspired us to group everything by type as we loaded and meant it could be removed and put away at lightning speed over at the cutlery drawer. This turns dishwashing into high art. There are so many great features here: classy interior lighting, a door that opens automatically to allow steam to escape at the end of a cycle, a whisperingly quiet programme (38db) for nights, trays and baskets with a zillion ways to customise in width and height. You can even trust it with your best crystal with its special GlassCare programme, which took good care of our whisky tumblers that we usually do by hand. Miele’s trademark flat cutlery tray on the top level means even the gunkiest serving spoons are sorted. The cleaning power is superb, with even its 58-minute QuickPowerWash programme reviving our Le Creuset roasting dishes to good-as-new condition. Like the cheaper Hoover Wizard, you can also control cycles, check salt and rinse aid or keep tabs on how much energy you have used via your smartphone. This freestanding dishwasher is one cool piece of kit but is going to require a larger-than-average space as it won’t fit under the standard work-top. If you want something less showy then opt for the integrated version, which has the same 13 place-setting capacity but in a more compact package. On this machine, there is a fast 27-minute setting here that is perfect for freshening up dusty glassware or lightly soiled plates. Run the Orbital Wash programme and a final blast of hot water ensures tricky-to-clean items, such as stained chopping boards, come out spotless. The self-balancing door is a bonus too as it won’t slam shut if you just want to remove a few items from the top tray. One of Hoover’s range of wifi enabled appliances, we weren’t convinced there was a real need for dishwashing wizardry rather than, say, an oven or washing machine. Yes, it is possible to get a dishwasher salt reminder or monitor energy consumption via the app but surely they are not essential. Then our tester went to bed and realised she had forgotten to start the loaded machine and so took care of business from under the duvet. Sold. On a less techy tip, we liked the way plates stacked in two rows from back to front and there was a deep centre tray up top for bulky utensils and knives. It is efficient at cleaning, if not the best dryer on test here. If you don’t have the under-counter space for a dishwasher but could clear a corner of the worktop, this compact and energy-efficient machine may be the answer. In theory, you should be able to fit six place settings in there, but with a medium-size saucepan and a few daytime coffee mugs too, we managed to clear up nicely after a simple supper for three. There are plenty of features you would find in full-size models, including timer delay, an intensive wash programme and something for delicates too. You will have to take it in stages to tackle a Sunday lunch but if it means chucking the scourer, it is okay with us. (It is also worth mentioning the brilliant Mychoice.co.uk site – you can search for your perfect dishwasher by noise level, place setting, energy rating, water consumption and more.) There are nine other colours to choose from with this model, as well as matching retro-inspired products from sensor bins to kettles and microwaves. Those clean lines mean you will have to open the door to check on controls if you don’t programme correctly first time, but the chunky pull handle made it easy to access. Upper and lower baskets were well positioned at default setting, giving taller glasses room on top. This model’s efficient cleaning and the well-balanced height of its baskets meant tall glasses fitted in its top slot with ease. The timer delay is a great feature if you would rather the machine didn’t run when you are around. The black gloss exterior of this machine has brushed steel accents for a high-tech look, though the touch-sensitive buttons can take a bit of getting used to. We liked the smaller additional half-size cutlery tray on top level which could be used for larger knives and baby bottle tops. It also meant the traditional basket on the bottom could be removed to make space for larger pans if necessary. It is another dishwasher that uses a mere six litres of water per cycle, so more good news on the water bill front.  In terms of form and function, the Miele dishwasher we tested was far superior, with the most versatility and cleaning prowess. Not everyone needs to clean cut glass and bone china, though, and the Beko model we tested is a great economy choice. Efficient, economical and at a great price, only t its bog-standard looks let it down a little.   We use cookies to enhance your visit to our site and to bring you advertisements that might interest you.

" Whip up delicious deserts, including sorbets and frozen yoghurts, from your kitchen Few sounds excite children more on a summer’s day than the jingle of an approaching ice-cream van. But there’s no need to leave your front door to enjoy delicious ice cream with these machines that enable you to create fabulous frozen treats at home. There are two types of model – fully automatic (with inbuilt freezer) and manual ones (where you have to pre-freeze the bowl first). Make your decision based on your budget, how much ice cream you plan to make, how much storage space you have (smaller ones are about the size of a kettle, but larger ones can be as big as a food processor) and how organised you are. After all, pre-freezing the bowl means you’ll need to plan ahead and find space in your freezer, whereas a built-in freezer machine means you can make ice cream at a moment’s notice.  Whichever type you choose, make sure the bowls will fit in your freezer and be sure to check that, if you’re going for a bigger machine, it’s not too heavy and cumbersome to move. It’s also worth remembering that the size of the bowl is not an indication of the amount of ice cream the machine is able to make, as it doesn’t account for the paddle and ability to churn the ingredients. If you want to see how much ice cream you can make in one go, check the specifications, although as a general rule of thumb, manual machines make around 0.8 litres of ice cream, while fully automatic ones can make up to 1.5 litres. To test them, we made a variety of ice creams and frozen desserts – yum. 1.   £280, amazon This is the most intelligent ice-cream maker around. As you’d expect from a model of this price, it’s got a built-in freezer so there’s no need to pre-freeze the mixing bowl, but unusually, it has an inbuilt sensor to determine the consistency of your ice cream, sorbet, gelato or frozen yoghurt so that it can stop mixing when it’s ready. The results are delicious and it even plays an ice cream van jingle when it’s ready. 2.  £30, IWOOT Many makers in this price range produce clumpy ice cream and you have to do lots of stopping and scraping as the mixture climbs up the side of the bowl. Not so with this machine which has been designed to prevent this happening. It has a retro 1950s look and 1.2 litre bowl, making us deliciously smooth raspberry frozen yoghurt and lemon sorbet, as well as vanilla ice cream within half an hour. You’ll need to pre-freeze the bowl. 3.   £15, Aldi As with all Aldi Specialbuys, there is limited stock, so once these are gone, they’re gone. We found the compact machine – which is available in white, berry, turquoise or lilac – on par with good machines double its price and the detachable motor means it’s easy to clean too. Most importantly, it makes a litre of tasty ice cream. Pre-freeze the bowl first.  4.   £29, amazon Once you’ve found room in your freezer to pre-freeze the bowl for eight hours, you’ll be ready to experiment with flavours such as salted caramel ice cream and mango sorbet, both of which worked a treat for us, and was ready in a quick 20 to 40 minutes, depending on consistency – although you might want to harden it up in the freezer before serving. 5.   £31, Wayfair This churns smooth, light and creamy ice cream quickly and is less noisy than many. We tried summer berry and vanilla ice cream and both worked well. As with others in this price bracket, you’re best off storing the removable bowl in the freezer so it’s always ready to go. Simple enough to assemble, and easy to use. 6.   £277, amazon Uniquely, this comes with two stainless steel bowl options – one fixed, the other removable – so if you’re an ice cream obsessive, you can just keep making batch after batch. Put some time aside to assemble it, but once you’ve got it up and running, you just need to turn on the built-in freezer five minutes before you start and you can then make anything from rum and raisin ice cream to passion fruit sorbet, which comes out with a perfect consistency and is ready-to-eat. The paddle is removable, whch makes it easier to get the ice cream out of the bowl and it’s got a huge capacity, enabling you to make two lots of two pints’ worth of ice cream. 7.   £240, amazon If you’re a gelato enthusiast, this robust machine might just be your new best friend. There’s a special gelato paddle to help incorporate air into the recipe, while the ice-cream paddle incorporates less air for a richer, denser finish. The built-in freezer means there’s no need to pre-freeze the bowl, so you can make ice cream in just 40 minutes, but it is very big.  8.   £23, amazon This was a great buy when it first hit the shelves, so now it’s on sale for half-price, it’s astonishingly good value for a machine that’s a doddle to use and has a very clear digital timer. Particularly good for people without much storage space, this compact machine requires you to pre-freeze the bowl, pop on the lid and pour in the ingredients. Voila – scrumptious frozen pud. 9.   £50, amazon If you don’t already own the  , don’t bother reading on. But if you do, this attachment (one of a whopping 20 that fits this machine) is a sound investment that will bring much joy to pudding time in your household. Freeze the inner bowl and paddle for 24 hours before using, at the same time as making your mixture and leaving it in the fridge, then churn your mixture for 20 minutes for flavoursome frozen treats. We found the attachment fits really easily on the machine, with the freezer bowl and paddle slotting neatly into the mixing bowl.  10.  £168, amazon Many professionals swear by this machine, despite it being significantly cheaper than most others with an inbuilt freezer. We think it’s down to the powerful churning and freezing action that means you get a professional finish in just 30 minutes. But be warned: the instruction manual could be more detailed and it can take time to get the right consistency when you first start using it. It’s hard not to be wowed by   – it has all the bells and whistles you can think of, and more, and makes delicious ice cream and other frozen treats. Our top choice for the manual range is  , which is easy to set up and use and makes gorgeous soft ice cream ready to serve – or freeze it for harder ice cream to enjoy later.

" After 12 months trying the latest releases, Andrew Griffin chooses his wish list  Being a technology writer might seem glamorous: among other perks, you get to use the latest technology before it’s released to the public. But it is mostly a matter of picking through tat – there’s an incredible amount of products put out each year, and almost all of them aren’t very good. What does stand out, however, are those traditional values that still underpin the very best products: a thoughtful, intentional approach, a concern for design, an interest in giving consumers an experience that is as rewarding in the long term as it is exciting when it first arrives. And it has been a year of beautiful, magical design: from the iPhone X that turned the traditional look into almost all screen, through to an Xbox that for once managed to look as nice on the outside as it performs on the inside. Those things might seem old-fashioned. But they’re becoming more important than ever as gadgets take up an increasingly important place in our lives, filling up our houses as well as our pockets and powering many of the most important parts of people’s day. Among that host of tat, important things shine. So this list is a celebration of products that, are more than anything else, good. Like the iPhone, this is one of the two standout products – and genuine surprises – of 2017. If this article was only two things long, it would be made up of those two things, and this one would be by far the most fun. The Switch is simply a beautifully enjoyable gadget. All of the big games are great fun – Mario Kart and Zelda, to name two – and the flexibility that gives the console its name is far less of a novelty than it might look at first. While it’s really just a console and a portable games machine put together in one box, it feels like an entirely new kind of product. Switching between the two is one short, fluid thing, and there’s little difficulty ever doing so. That’s one of the reasons it feels so exciting: in a year that is dominated by new versions of old things (phones, consoles, earphones, speakers), it was probably the one gadget that seemed entirely new. While the iPhone is always world-leading, there has come to be a steady, drudging inevitability to the new releases: every year comes something a bit faster, with a better camera, packed into the same old design that might come with new colours. This year changed all that. Apple released the iPhone 8 first, of course, which kept to the familiar pattern and offered people who wanted a cheaper or more familiar – but still much better – phone. Then came the iPhone X. Out were the home button and all the rest of the things that have signalled the iPhone’s design for years. In came a stunning new look that propels Apple’s handsets into the future. It overtook the competitors and soared past. Using it – even a few weeks in – still feels exciting in a way that no phone has for years. Features like animoji are fun; other innovations like the incredibly detailed camera are both useful and eternally impressive. It’s no surprise that Apple made the best phone of 2017. It’s not even a surprise that it made the best gadget of 2017. What is truly surprising about the iPhone X is that it feels more like the best gadget of 2018, 2019 – or many years to come. This was the year of the new consoles that were actually old, or the old consoles that became new. Both the Xbox and PS4 received updates that were somewhere between a new generation and an update – and both of them were great. The headline feature of the One X – like that of the PS4 Pro – is 4K. But in actual fact that’s just the beginning, and there’s a whole range of features that make the latest iteration of the Xbox so impressive. Chief among them is the look. The appearance of the Xbox has never been its strong suit, even while its internals have got better and better. But the X comes in a sleek, matte black and a design with none of the jagged edges or protrusions that have made previous versions look a little like a badly put together spaceship. From there come vastly improved internals. The machine is much quicker, making loading and playing a better experience, and the 4K is a benefit even to people without ultra-HD televisions, because it improves how much can be shown on screen. The iPhone might be Apple’s big innovation of recent years. But no iPhone has ever changed my life quite how the AirPods did. On the face of it, they might sound a little dull: they’re just the earphones that come with your iPhone but with the wires cut away, allowing you to connect to them over bluetooth. But that connection is incredible, allows you to share them with every other Apple device you own, and the smarts that are baked into the earphones – Siri, the ability to pause by just taking one out of your ear, and charging by just dropping them into a little tic-tac box – shift them from being good to great. Apple has developed a habit recently of introducing quietly brilliant products that are dwarfed by the phone, and perhaps don’t get discussed quite as much. The AirPods are right within that, perhaps overlooked because it’s hard to get excited about earbuds. (The Apple Watch Series 3 came out this year, too, and while a great upgrade the fact that I’m on Three and so can’t actually use its headline feature of cellular connectivity made it harder to pick as one of the best of the year.) The AirPods actually came out at the end of last year – cutting in about a week before Christmas. But they weren’t easily available until well into 2017, so they’ve been allowed to sneak into this year’s round-up. Sonos really does one thing: makes speakers that connect to the internet, and does it very well. Its whole line sounds incredible, and looks it too. But this year it launched its speaker that actually listens to you, as well as letting you listen to it. The Sonos One has Alexa inside of it, meaning that among other things you can ask for any song you can think of and have it play. It was a big breakthrough for the speaker firm, and came with a new philosophy that it espoused as it released it: one that would see it open up its platform, introduce new ways of controlling them such as voice, and make them the future of sound in the smart home. Much of that comes from the Sonos One – but above all, it’s just a very smart, very good-looking, speaker, and one that you’ll be very happy to let into your home. Sonos also released its beautiful looking and sounding PlayBase this year – like a soundbar but much wider, and which can also serve as a stand for your TV. It’s just as great as the One, but isn’t quite so surprising or futuristic. Dyson might be known as a vacuum company. But in recent years they’ve actually got incredibly good at vacuuming other things: the air, and your hair. The company’s purifiers double as fans and heaters, and that’s what they do best. The fans chuck out heat and cold with a great deal of efficiency. And they clean the air too, like a vacuum but for everything that’s not on the floor. I didn’t realise quite how much of a difference cleaning the air would make to my life. It might be entirely psychological but turning this on does seem to do something to the air – making it fresher, smoother, nicer. It’s very expensive for a purifier, of course – even if that also blows hot and cool air at the same time, and connects to the internet so that you can control it remotely, even with Alexa. But it’s very good for a purifier, too. (This actually came out in the UK last year, but has been rolling out elsewhere throughout 2017.) The electric car might be the thing you hear all the chatter about, but it might actually be the electric bike that transforms cities. And the Volt Pulse is the perfect argument for that happening. Like all electric bikes, the idea is fairly simply, but revolutionary. The bike features a battery and a motor that can help you out when needed, making light work of climbing hills and giving the option for incredibly speedy starts. And the Pulse is a beautiful execution of that idea. Its design isn’t especially chic for a city bike, but it looks like what it is: a powerful, well-engineered, high quality way to get around town.  To get it out of the way: this is very expensive. It is, probably, not worth it – unless you’re very, very committed to drinking coffee. If that is the case (and you’re ready to spend a lot of money on your coffee machine) this does the job. It fits the bill of beautifully engineered, smart products in 2017. And when I was sent one I had a great deal of fun using it. It’s bean-to-cup so you get all the freshness of newly ground coffee at home, can be controlled with an app, has a touchscreen to let you choose and see the coffee you’re about to drink, and even lets froths the milk for you. And all of that is packed into a machine that’s made of shining, stunning chrome, making your kitchen feel a little more like an Italian cafe. The coffee is good – very good. The options are diverse, letting you create all kinds of interesting concoctions. There are cheaper coffee machines, of course. But there are few so beautifully put together. The   is simply a stunning piece of work. It’s sometimes easy to forget what an unusual joy it is to have a smartphone: that little pocketable slab that can summon and capture all of the world’s information and people. The X brought back some of that surprise, with a beautiful design that makes it feel like the first really new iPhone in years, and the future of the smartphones to come. But the   is just so much fun. While if I was offered just one of these devices I’d pick the phone, I’d spend the entire time after wishing I’d got the Switch. It’s exciting, it’s intriguing, and it’s ambitious – at a time when most of the good products around are so mature that they have lost much of the element of surprise. The iPhone X is this year’s best product. But the Switch is this year’s best gadget.

" Make yourself a fresh and flavoursome morning cuppa with a precision piece of kitchen kit There’s a lot of science behind why you should grind your own coffee beans, but it essentially boils down to two words: freshness and flavour. By grinding your own beans you are able to maximise the freshness of your coffee and get the best taste out of your brew without pesky oxidisation. There are three main types of grinder: blade, burr and hand – there are also subcategories within these but we don’t want you reaching for a coffee to survive the coffee guide. Blade grinders are at the cheaper end of the market as they cut the beans, which heats them up in the process, reducing the quality of your cuppa. Burr grinders on the other hand, while more expensive, crush the coffee and produce more consistent and better quality grinds. Hand mills require a lot of work as they are manually operated but afford the greatest control. Different grinders may specify whether they are geared towards a certain brew – for instance, some grind better for espressos and some for filter, while the real champs can do it all. If you want to be making espressos or Turkish coffee, make sure you pick up a burr grinder that produces a fine grind, as blade mills at the cheaper end of the market tend to struggle with anything finer than coarse filter coffee.  There’s plenty else to consider: check whether the grinder’s capacity suits your needs, as you don’t want to shell out for a silo-sized grinder when you’re making solo cups. Stepped grinders are easier for setting which grind you want to achieve, whereas stepless machines are more fluid, allowing you extra freedom but less reliability. If you tend to make the same coffee each time then stepless may be the way to go but be wary of losing that perfect coarseness you found. We’re looking for as many grind settings as possible so that you can get the right cup of coffee for your mood. Part of the Sage range by Heston Blumenthal – our very own modern day Willy Wonka – this grinder has extensive capabilities and, let’s be honest, a downright gorgeous appearance. There are a huge number of grind settings, 60, to be exact, with the ability to set the time in 0.2 second increments; if you’re looking to make filter coffee you need a coarser, shorter grind, for espresso or Turkish coffee then you’ll need a much finer and longer grind. This grinder also specialises in, well, everything, allowing you to select on the LCD interface which cup you are looking to brew, be it French or filter. Only a breath away from your local coffee shop. One of the cheapest grinders on our list is also one of the most consistent. While the De’Longhi is a simple burr grinder, it performs its duties admirably and is great for anybody still finding their feet with home-brewed coffee. The machine is incredibly easy to operate and even easier to clean with the upper wheel of its grinder core simple to remove. Dosage ranges from two to 12 cups, with the grinder shutting off automatically once your dosage is reached. You can also choose your fineness from fine, medium or coarse. It’s a solid piece of equipment that won’t break the bank, though it’s lacking in scope for personalisation. This blade grinder makes it here as it is great value for money. Although a blade grinder may not produce the same quality taste as its burr or hand mill cousins, it does do the job on the cheap and does it consistently. The Swan hasn’t broken on us nor has it slowed down in operation, giving you a fresh cup in a matter of moments, and it is quiet and efficient. This grinder may not bowl over the purists but if you’re just looking to add a touch more freshness to your morning brew without shelling out a couple hundred then this is perfect for you, though you could be disappointed by the one setting. The most aesthetically focused grinder on the list was designed by the Italian duo Daniel Debiasi and Federico Sandri and inspired by the Nordic landscape. The Stelton gets points for ease of use. It is a hand mill, adjustable to whichever coarseness you like, giving you a lot of freedom over how your cup tastes. It even has a handy lid for storing any coffee you may want to save for later. We reckon this is the most beautiful coffee grinder on the list, and a must have for anyone who subscribes to the Scandinavian “less is more” philosophy. This is another grinder that serves anywhere from two to 12 cups’ worth at a time, and does so with great consistency. The Krups comes equipped with a dual burr grinding system that is no chore to maintain due to the easily removable upper burr. There are 17 grind settings to choose from to suit which cuppa you’re after. The hopper holds up to 225g of coffee and is airtight to keep beans as fresh as possible. All round, this is a solid piece of kit for the price, just pipping the De’Longhi – its closest competitor – due to the superior grind settings and capacity. This Dualit offering is a sensible option if the whole family likes a coffee. The large capacity of 250g – up to 35 cups in the hopper – makes it ideal for those looking to caffeinate families, small offices or cults (we do not endorse cults, just this grinder). There are 10 grind settings to choose from and with a two-year guarantee from John Lewis this is a great investment. However, the grind is a tad slower than other grinders due to the conical burr system, although this does minimise clogging and the heat produced in the grind to keep your beans nice and fresh. This list simply would not be complete without an inclusion from Baratza. Those that are into their coffee will no doubt know the name, those that don’t need only know that it exudes quality. This grinder comes with a hefty price tag of nearly £500 and as such is not one for the faint-hearted – caffeine aficionados only beyond this point. The grind is incredibly consistent and super-fast, grinding at a rate of 3.5-5.5 grams per second, giving you a fresh cup in just a couple of seconds. The coffee retention is at a minimum, which aids efficiency and your pocket. There are 30 macro settings and nine micro adjustments you can make to give you a signature brew. The 400g capacity hopper dwarves its competitors in this guide while still fitting on most kitchen counters. An incredibly impressive grinder with a lot to offer to the right enthusiast. It’s all about simplicity and value for money with this straightforward blade grinder from Andrew James. It’s operated by a single button, which eliminates the possibility of any fine tuning, although the transparent lid means you can keep an eye on how finely ground your beans are becoming. It also means that the beans aren’t as consistently ground as other models and it’s not the quickest, but considering the price, it’s certainly impressive. It’s not as loud as you might imagine, either, which was a nice surprise. You can also grind nuts and spices, if you feel so inclined, but we found it was most adept at tackling coffee beans. A great option if you want freshly ground coffee without the hefty price tag. This burr grinder occupies the space between Cuisinart’s budget and premium machines, and as such brings together a nice mix of the two: handy features at a not-so-wallet-emptying price. The 18 grind settings, increasing incrementally from fine to medium to coarse, give you good versatility for the price, and you can make anywhere between four and 18 cups at a time – so we reckon it’s best for families or the office. Our beans were mostly ground consistently, although not quite with the military precision of pricier models (to be expected), still delivering a delicious cuppa. If you end up making more than you need, there’s a handy chamber below to store leftovers. An added bonus is that the parts are safe to pop in the dishwasher and clean. We were instantly enamoured with the retro stylings that grace this burr grinder. Its steel construction gives it a sturdy, premium feel as it sits pretty atop your kitchen work surface. It has 15 grind settings, allowing for a whole range of different coffees, and we found the grinds were consistent. What’s more, stainless steel blades spin at a relatively low 450rpm – the thinking is that at a slower speed, there will be less friction, less heat and better taste. It certainly seems to work. The compartments are made from glass, adding to its visual appeal, and the noise is far from excessive. A solid choice for the discerning coffee fan. Also comes with a burr cleaning brush and a bean scooper. Taking all into account you can’t beat the model from  . The super slick LCD interface and gorgeously modern appearance are supplemented by the vast choice of 60 settings, which puts this grinder head and shoulders above its rivals, with an aromatic arabica in hand.

" Take the toil out of food preparation with a multi-tasking machine A decent stand mixer takes all the boring bits out of making cakes, breads, pastries and puddings and more. But with prices ranging from £100 up to well over £400, how do you know which one to buy? The first question to ask yourself is whether you need a pure stand mixer – which will mix, whisk, whip and knead – or if you want a more comprehensive kitchen machine that can also tackle jobs such as chopping, slicing, blending and mincing. Next, work out exactly what you’ll need it for and read our reviews to find out which machines in your price range excel at those specific tasks. How solid is the build? Is it easy to set up? Is it intuitive to use? Is it a nightmare to clean? Will you want to store it away? These are other issues to consider. Think about capacity too, depending on whether you want it for a small family or to make very big batches, and try to find out how easy it will be to replace spare parts if you need them. After all, at these prices, you’ll want your mixer to last you a very long time. 1.   £280, Amazon This quiet, easy-to-use, retro-looking machine was used on last year’s Great British Bake. It does a first-rate job of mixing, whipping and kneading and it’s not bad at whisking. It’s heavy (8kg) and there’s nowhere to store the cord, so be prepared to keep it on display. 2.   £400, John Lewis This digital machine is the quietest we tested and is a cinch to use. Superb at kneading and whipping and pretty good at mixing, it’s not as quick as some others, but it’s worth the wait. At 7kg, you’ll probably want to keep it on the worktop. 3.   £85, Amazon It’s a bit tricky to put together, but this machine is worth the effort as it’s very good at whisking, mixing, kneading and whipping, helping to produce some great cakes and pastries. It’s a basic, no-frills machine, but if you don’t need any extras, this will serve you very well. 4.   £145, Amazon  Whisking, grating, whipping and mixing are among the kitchen tasks this three-in-one machine excels at, although we found it disappointing at kneading and poor at slicing. It comes with numerous accessories, along with a jug for the blender. Very heavy. 5.   £135, Amazon This attractive machine does most of the core tasks well, including whipping and whisking, and it’s exceptionally good at kneading, leading to some fabulous bread. But with a maximum of three minutes operating time, bigger kitchen tasks will require patience. 6.  £500, Amazon This is like having your very own sous chef in the kitchen. It quickly and effectively chops, grates, slices, whisks, kneads, blends and more. It’s also very easy to use and clean, although it does take a while to assemble. Some attachments are sold separately.  7.   £550, John Lewis This sturdy machine does a great job of mixing, not missing a crumb, and it’s good at whisking too. It’s quickest when whipping and kneading, though. At over 10kg it’s a challenge to move, but it looks great and is available in some fabulous colours. 8.   £296, Amazon It’s cheap, but this machine is brilliant at mixing and whipping. You never need to scrape the bowl to incorporate the ingredients, like you do on some cheaper machines. It’s not as strong as whisking and kneading, though, so is better for making cakes than bread. 9.   £250, Amazon This machine’s bowl-sweeping motion leaves no mixture behind. It’s also good at kneading, although whisking is average. And because it’s a three-in-one machine, there’s also a blending jug and food shredder. A great all-rounder. 10.   from £500, John Lewis There’s nothing this machine doesn’t do: it’s great at mixing, blending, whisking, whipping, chopping, slicing, grating and juicing. There’s even a special bowl for mixing larger quantities. It does take some time, but it’s justified by the end product. The   does the basics exceptionally well, making it our top budget recommendation. For a more comprehensive, versatile machine, we think the   stands out.

" Whether it’s a lungo or latte, get a great-tasting drink in seconds with one of these machines The capsule coffee machine is a supremely useful invention, offering outstanding convenience for coffee lovers who want to enjoy a barista-quality cuppa from the comfort of their own home.  There are a wide variety of capsule machines on the market, most of which are designed to work with specific proprietary capsule systems such as Nespresso, Dolce Gusto, Tassimo and other top brands. Many of these machines are produced by some of the most notable names in the coffee space (Delonghi, Lavazza, Krups and so on), so generally speaking, you won’t have any problems with quality if you stick with the better-known companies.  One of the main factors to consider when choosing a capsule machine is pump pressure (measured in bars), as it will determine how much flavour the machine can extract from each coffee capsule, as well as the quality of the crema when brewing espressos. A good rule of thumb is to choose a machine that has at least 15 bars of pump pressure, as do all of the machines listed here (except the lighter-duty Lavazza Jolie).  If you’re looking for the best coffee-capsule machine among the many choices that are available, below are 10 top picks that really stand out from the crowd.  With eight different beverage selections, the Sage Nespresso Creatista Plus offers you plenty of options for preparing barista-style coffee from your kitchen worktop. The machine is super-easy to use, with an intuitive high-resolution display that guides you through the coffee preparation process in short order. This machine features a 19-bar pump, so you won’t ever have to worry about achieving adequate flavour extraction. Lovers of milk-based coffee drinks will have a field day with this machine, as it provides 11 different milk temperature settings as well as eight different texture levels to help you precisely control milk-froth quality. All in all, the Creatista Plus is an elegantly designed workhorse that brews great tasting coffee.  The Krups Nespresso Expert enables you to prepare bespoke brews according to your own personal preferences. You can whip up espresso, ristretto, lungo, or Nespresso Americano coffee drinks using three different temperature settings (medium, hot and extra-hot), and as far as operational efficiency goes, using this machine really couldn’t be any simpler. It’s as easy as pushing a couple of buttons, or you can set everything up using your phone, thanks to the Bluetooth connectivity and Nespresso app. This machine is highly efficient, with 19 bars of pump pressure to force every atom of flavour out of each coffee capsule. The Dualit Cafe Cino is a delightfully compact capsule machine that offers a level of versatility that belies its modest size. Not only does it brew cappuccino, espresso, latte, and lungo beverages, but you can even pop in a tea pod when you’re in the mood for a different type of cuppa. Its programmable dosing memory allows you to customise the flavour extraction to whatever setting you find most agreeable. One of biggest standout features of this machine is its cold-milk-frothing option, which allows you to create creamy milkshakes anytime the mood hits you. In some respects, the Cafe Cino is more of a multi-function beverage-producing machine than just a coffee maker, although it facilitates coffee preparation with remarkable efficiency. Those who are familiar with the Lavazza name are well aware of the company’s legendary status in the coffee space, and its stellar reputation is well represented in this beautifully designed machine. It features a 10-bar pump for efficient flavour extraction, and its mind-blowingly simple push-button operation makes preparing a cup of joe an extremely easy affair. The machine is compact and quiet, emitting only 44dB of sound during the brewing cycle – a welcome departure from other capsule machines that can tend to sound like garbage disposals when in operation. With one-touch operation and removable dishwasher-safe parts, ease of use gives the Lavazza Jolie a distinct edge against its similarly priced competitors.  Outfitted to work with Nescafé Dolce Gusto pods, the Dolce Gusto Eclipse is nothing short of a work of art in the design department. The machine looks more like a sculpture you would find in a modern art museum than a coffee maker, but don’t let its stylish, ring-shaped configuration fool you – the Eclipse offers rock-solid performance and versatility, accommodating over 30 different varieties of hot and cold beverages. It also features a highly intuitive touch-screen control panel for hassle-free operation, as well as 15 bars of pump pressure to produce quality coffee drinks of a calibre that you would typically find in high-street shops.  Whether you’re a fan of espressos, cappuccinos or both, you’ll find plenty of versatility in the De’Longhi Lattissima Pro. It features a patented milk-foaming system, operated by touch screen, which allows you to create heavenly milk-based concoctions such as latte macchiatos and cappuccinos without having to fuss with milk pods or steam wands to accomplish the job. The intuitive interface enables you to programme the machine to suit your specific tastes, and with 19 bars of pump pressure, quality flavour-extraction is a given. The Lattissima Pro only takes 25 seconds to warm up for regular coffee drinks, and 40 seconds for milk-based drinks. The Lavazza Modo Mio Espria Plus offers the perfect combination of elegant design and cutting-edge technology, with one-touch controls and a smart LED screen that will assist you in managing and maintaining the machine. It accepts Lavazza capsules through the top of the machine, keeping everything clean and simple, and the agreeable spout height allows you to place your coffee mug in position without any hassle. With a 40-second heat-up time and 15 bars of pump pressure, the Espria Plus offers efficient, no-frills operation that gets the job done, and with its sleek metallic silver-grey finish, this machine will make a fine addition to any kitchen worktop.    Designed by renowned architect Piero Lissoni, the newly released, whimsically named Francis Francis Y3.2 by illy offers a smart combination of elegance and functionality. Designed for iperEspresso and iperCoffee capsules, the Y3.2 prepares remarkably flavourful, barista-style coffee. Simplicity and convenience are the primary features of this machine, as it offers two programmable coffee settings, one-touch operation and automatic ejection of used capsules. It has a stylish yet compact design that makes it a good fit for practically any kitchen worktop.  When time is at a premium, this machine is the one you want in your kitchen. The Tassimo Suny features a Smart Start button on the front of the machine that is activated when you press your cup against it, allowing for ultra-quick drink preparation. Since this machine is compatible with all T-Disc capsules, it can create coffee, tea and/or chocolate beverages with equal facility. The Tassimo Suny also features intelligent barcode technology that takes all the guesswork out of drink preparation. When you pop the T-Disc into the top of the machine, it will read the barcode and then adjust its settings to prepare the drink according to the prescribed specifications. Not only does this make the process of creating your favourite beverage super easy, but it guarantees a consistency of performance that you’re sure to appreciate on a daily basis.  When it comes to stylish design, it’s hard to beat the look of the KitchenAid Nespresso Maker. It has a “retro-chic” aesthetic that evokes a classic 1950s-diner feel, but its functionality embodies the best that modern coffee-making technology has to offer. This KitchenAid coffee maker is designed to work with Nespresso Grands Crus capsules, and it offers six pre-programmed cup sizes that can be adjusted by way of one simple brewing button. The KitchenAid also features an LED display that provides intuitive indication of the machine’s status, and with its fast heat-up time (under 30 seconds), you’ll be drinking your delicious cup of java within minutes of turning on the machine.   While it’s obvious that price will be one of the top priorities on your list, you should also factor in how the machine will complement your lifestyle. If your coffee needs are relatively minimal (you’re the only coffee lover in your house, for instance), you might be better off sticking with a lighter-duty machine such as the  . If you’re a tech-inclined person who fancies smart gadgets and appliances, you’ll probably warm up to the Bluetooth-enabled  . If aesthetic appeal is one of your main considerations, no doubt the   and   machines will be top choices. If you are looking for a great all-rounder that excels in most of the aspects that matter for a capsule coffee machine, go for  , our Best Buy.

" Get started on that make-your-own project with the help of kit suited to your skills Home sewing is having a moment. Whether you're returning to long-lost skills from earlier in life or picking up the fabric shears for the first time, how do you even begin to choose your all-important sewing machine?  The variety of options available can be baffling and your ideal match will depend on what you’d like to make. Do you see yourself whipping up cushions and quilts? Or sewing yourself a whole new wardrobe? As well as machines I’ve used when making my own pieces – you can see those on my   – I’ve pulled together the advice of some of the best home sewers in the business to test out machines with features to suit every budding stitcher.  A well-chosen machine can last you a lifetime and I recommend investing in something sturdy that can handle some experimentation while you flex your creative muscles. Too many confusing features can overwhelm a beginner but which are essential? A quality straight stitch, zigzag and the function to sew a buttonhole in either one or four steps will see you through a surprising amount of projects.  Features like memory options and a lever to lift the presser foot with your knee are probably only necessary if you’re sewing more often than part-time. Equally you can probably do without a dual feed, which evenly pulls the fabric through from both above and below. It’s a handy feature when using tricky fabrics but you can buy a separate foot to do this if needed in future. However, a needle up/down function and a bobbin that loads from above with a clear cover so you can see when it’s running out could be invaluable. Some might feel traditional manual machines are easier to understand but during my research, Tony at   opened my eyes to the wonderful world of computerised machines and how they can save you time and hassle when just starting out. Many of these modern machines can select the optimum length and width of particular stitches for you, removing the guesswork and limiting your mistakes. Very similar to the Janome 525 used on  , but a touch more affordable, this model ticks all the boxes. Three dials select stitch type, length and width. There’s an automatic one-step buttonhole and easy to load bobbin with clear cover, and it feels weighty with more metal parts than most machines in this price range. The set-up of this will feel comfortable and familiar to anyone who has done a bit of sewing in the past and learnt to sew on classic manual machines. This model is the one that changed my mind about computerised machines. I thought all the features might be too confusing for a beginner but found it very intuitive when I tried it out. The 16 stitch options, including stretch stitches, are selected with a simple jog dial and it has all the electronic essentials with a stop/start button, speed limiter, needle threader and needle up/down control. Threading is so easy – the machine even pulls the bobbin thread up for you. If you’re on a budget and just dipping your toe in the waters of home sewing, this basic machine will do the job very nicely. The 14 stitch options are plenty for the majority of projects and the classic set-up means you can get sewing fairly quickly with a read of the manual. If you’re looking to sew with stretch fabrics, you might miss being able to control the stitch width plus the bobbin is concealed behind a door on the front which can be tricky to access if you get in a tangle. But it’s a sturdy machine and is available in a lovely range of colours. Although marketed to those with intermediate sewing skills, a good friend of mine purchased this fully computerised model as her first machine and is in love. If you’ve got big sewing dreams of making jeans and coats, it’s a machine that will grow with you, and is good value for money considering the multitude of features it comes with including speed control and a stop/start button with automatic foot release so you don’t even have to use the foot pedal. Stitches are easily selected using the dial and LCD screen.  Another easy-to-understand computerised machine which won’t be outgrown quickly, this has 47 pre-programmed stitches and three styles of one-step buttonholes to choose from. It’s a true workhorse which handles a variety of different fabrics with ease, from slippery silks to thick coating that some of the more basic machines may struggle with. It doesn’t come with as many feet as some machines in this price bracket but the bonus of buying a Janome is that a wide range are readily available to purchase fairly inexpensively.  As the name suggests, this is a sturdy piece of kit that handles heavier upholstery fabrics, denim, leather and vinyl like a dream. It stitches smoothly and can still be used for delicate and lightweight fabrics, but it does sew at some speed so that might put off beginners wanting to sink their teeth into intricate projects. Other entry-level manual Singer models felt a little flimsy so the metal frame and components were a pleasant surprise and the stitch quality and ease of use surpassed my expectations when tested. In fact I worked on one for a couple of days and had no niggles at all. This is one of the more affordable models from the much-loved Bernina brand and is up there with the easiest of computerised machines to operate on the market. Press the button next to the stitch you want and away you go. It combines all the features of the other machines reviewed (with the exception of a stop/start button) and can be personalised with vinyl “skins” which you can design yourself. The LCD screen even shows you which snap-on presser foot to use. Additional machine feet and accessories can be expensive but if you’re ambitious about your new hobby or are starting out in the industry, a reliable machine like this is well worth the investment. The   stands out as the best affordable all-rounder. It’s a strong, straightforward machine that can handle a wide variety of fabrics and should meet all your needs. If you prefer the idea of a computerised model, the   also covers all bases. Both are great choices from reliable brands that strike a good balance between overly complex and too basic to cope with more challenging projects as you improve Follow IndyBest on   and  We use cookies to enhance your visit to our site and to bring you advertisements that might interest you.

" Tackle stubborn creases and power through your pile of clean laundry with an effective appliance As with so many small appliances, the first rule of buying a new iron is not to assume that the more expensive the machine, the better it is. We’ve tested steam irons across all price ranges and discovered that some of the no-frills models beat the swanky-looking ones hands down when it comes to banishing creases. Next up, work out what kind of iron you need. Steam generator irons are designed to pump out continuous steam – and plenty of it – but they tend to be much pricier and bulkier than steam irons. And in fact, we found that some of the best traditional irons actually don’t lag far behind when it comes to steam power.  Ideally, your iron will have a comfy handle and won’t be too heavy to hold in your hand for long periods. It will have a thin and tapered soleplate, which is easier to reach under buttons and into tight pleats, as well as being scratch-resistant so rogue zips don’t bring an end to your smooth gliding surface. Your dream iron will also have a nice long cord, as well as an easy-to-see water level and easy-to-fill tank. Safety features are good if you’re prone to getting distracted or have children around – and if you live in a hard water area, make sure it’s limescale resistant. In reality, a single iron is unlikely to tick everything on your wish list, so consider your priorities, read our round-up and take your pick. 1.  £49.99, Argos This powerful and effective iron is testament to the fact that high prices and long lists of fancy features don’t always mean better products. Indeed, this no-frills, relatively low cost iron does what matters most – providing lots of continuous steam to make short work of de-creasing your clothes. The thin soleplate with pointed tip gets in the trickiest of spots and there’s an energy saving setting, as well as good limescale defences. Our only niggle is that it can be hard to see the water level. 2.   £58, Amazon The sheer steaminess of this iron will help you blitz through your ironing pile, giving your clothes a very smooth finish. In fact, it knocks the socks off several far more expensive models we tried that didn’t make it into our round-up. There’s no need to fiddle with different settings for different fabrics (although there is a steam boost function for really deep creases, plus a handy vertical steamer for suits and curtains) and it’s easy to store. As for grumbles, the soleplate is on the thick side and a full water tank only lasts 10 minutes. 3.   £44.82, Amazon You get a lot of bling for your cha-cha-ching with this one and while it would be easy to assume that it’s all show and no substance, that’s not the case at all. Beneath the opulent gold finish is a fabulous bit of kit, with lots of steam, a comfortable handle and a great soleplate, all of which combine to expel creases from all fabrics, even jeans that have dried like cardboard. It’s resistant to limescale too, but it’s not the lightest iron and you’ll need patience in waiting for it to heat up as we found it took a good couple of minutes. Plus, there’s no automatic shut-off.   4.   £34, Amazon You won’t need much elbow grease with this iron, which smoothens out fabric with even the lightest touch, even though it’s not the steamiest we’ve used. You can hit the ground running as it’s quick to heat up (around 30 seconds) and it’s easy to store away after use, thanks to an innovative cord storage system. Don’t go near it if you’re in a hard water area, though, as there’s no built-in limescale filter, and also be aware that it needs cleaning regularly. 5.   £35, Amazon Turn screwed up piles of clothes and sheets into perfectly pressed piles with this iron that’s packed with nifty features including a big 400ml, easy-fill tank, comfortable handle, steam shot, extra-sturdy heel to rest it on, self-clean function, long 3m cord and anti-drip technology. It puffs out high levels of steam, with added safety features including an auto shut-off and a safe-store indicator to let you know when it’s cool enough to stash away. But it’s heavy, needs refilling every 10 minutes and the soleplate is prone to scratching. 6.   £54.50, John Lewis Most people would think twice about spending over 50 quid on a steam iron, but this is a first-rate model from a reliable brand that will leave your laundry without a wrinkle in sight. And although you only get around 12 minutes of continuous steam, it races through fabrics so speedily that it doesn’t really matter. The scratch-resistant soleplate has a precision tip (great for reaching between buttons) and a steam boost that can be used vertically. Limescale build-up is kept to a minimum, but it’s quite heavy, at 2kg. 7.   £59, Argos The so-called “tri-zone” soleplate on this iron is designed to tackle creases in three different ways, while removing excess water so that re-creasing doesn’t occur – a system that clearly works as this very steamy iron worked a treat on everything from light cotton dresses to heavy denims. We also found it worked brilliantly when used vertically on curtains and it’s great for preventing limescale too. Plus, it’s ready to go in 30 seconds – ideal if you need to tear out of the door – and there’s an extra-long cable. But the soleplate isn’t as thin as others we tried, so reaching under buttons can be awkward. 8.   £40, Lakeland Irons can be a nightmare to fill up with water – with more dribbling down the sides and back into the sink than in the water tank itself. Not so with this iron which has a helpfully big opening. It’s lightweight, which can make a world of difference to a large ironing pile, and it doesn’t let limescale build up. There’s a big water tank, providing a whopping 40 minutes of continuous ironing before it needs refilling, but as it isn’t the steamiest, you may need to go over stubborn creases more than once. 9.   £49.95, John Lewis Another pricey iron that we think is worth the extra dosh, this one effortlessly glides over even the most persistent creases, effortlessly transforming them with speed and puffing out continuous steam in its wake. On the rare occasion that a wrinkle gets the better of it, the steam boost – which also works vertically – will win over. The soleplate has been designed to work in any direction and even the sharpest of zips won’t scratch it. It’s easy to clean, but it’s heavy and quite cumbersome to hold for long periods. 10.   £49.99, Amazon This is Tefal’s newest steam iron and it’s a godsend for people in hard water areas as the patented technology means the steam holes don’t block. It’s continuously steamy (some irons are annoyingly irregular in steam distribution), has a long 3m cord and is comfortable to hold, even for long periods, although it’s easy to press the spray button inadvertently. We also found it can spit out water, but only occasionally, and the black exterior makes it tricky to see how much water is left in the iron. Despite the relatively low price-tag, we became instant fans of the  . In fact, the only downside we could find was that the water level isn’t that easy to see. The   particularly impressed us too, making shorter work of ironing than any other iron in our list. Finally, if you’re feeling the pinch, the   is a sound investment, provided you’re not in a hard water area.

" From wooden floor and carpet to ovens and tiles, keep surfaces looking sparkling with a powerful cleaning machine The idea behind steam cleaners is to make short work of cleaning floors and surfaces. It does this by heating up water to produce steam at high pressure, which in turn gets rid of germs, dirt and grease in record time. But in reality, many steam cleaners fail to deliver what they promise, meaning that you really need to do your homework before buying one. First off, work out what type you need – a steam mop or handheld steam cleaner, a combination of the two, or a cylinder steam cleaner. A steam mop is an upright machine with a water tank attached to the handle and is designed to clean hard floors, while handheld machines are more compact and aim to keep anything from ovens to showers clean and sparkling (usually with attachments for different surfaces). Increasingly, you can find machines that do both – acting as an upright model with a removable hand-held unit, usually built into the handle. The cylinder steam cleaner is also designed to tackle all the jobs of steam mops and handheld cleaners combined – and thanks to the barrel-shaped main body, they produce long steaming times, although they tend to take longer to get ready for use and are heavier. Check your machine has all the attachments you need – a squeegee to clean glass, for instance, or a scrubbing brush for grout. How long does it take to heat up and even more importantly, how long does the tank last (as this can range from eight minutes to continuous)? Also research what the machine you want to buy excels in – rarely do they shine at everything they say they do. Even the muddiest of footprints and stickiest of jam poses no challenge for this superb steam mop, which heats up in around 30 seconds and lasts over 20 minutes on a full tank, leaving surfaces near-dry straight after use. And because it uses double-sided pads, which can be flipped over when one side gets dirty (then bunged in the washing machine), you can clean twice as much floor in one go. It’s first-rate at stains too, but you can only use it on hard floors.   This can work as both a handheld machine for the likes of grouting and tiles, and as an upright mop for floors, including ceramic, lino, stone, wood, parquet, marble and carpet. The head swivels, which makes it a boon for difficult corners, and anyone in a hard water area will be grateful for the effective limescale filer. You get plenty of accessories including an angled nozzle and tools for window cleaning and dusting, plus various absorbent machine-washable cloths -  and although there’s only 10 minutes of steam time in one go, it’s easy to refill the tank. Beware though, it leaves the areas it has cleaned wet and it’s not great at glass. This top-of-the-range cylinder steam cleaner doesn’t come cheap, but we think it’s worth the extra dosh if you want something with serious oomph and versatility. Plus points include the special mechanism that provides continuous cleaning time and swivelled head that gives a really deep, powerful clean. Plus, it cleans well not only on hard floors but carpets, although the cleaning performance was ever so slightly less impressive on the latter. It can blast the smallest of crevices, along with stairs, with ease and it loosens dirt and removes stains effortlessly, as well as being a cinch to move around.     This lightweight handheld steam cleaner comes in at a great price and with a whopping 11 accessories to tackle everything from barbecue grills to windows, as well as shower cubicles to removing wrinkles out of curtains. Designed to be filled straight from the tap, we were impressed, although be warned that you can’t use it for more than about 10 minutes on the trot, if that, as your thumb gets sore. And once the tank runs out, you have to let it cool down for at least five minutes before you can refill it and use again.   This two-in-one steam mop is a joy to steer and use, thanks to the unique handstick design and swivel head, and it does a good job on both hard floors and carpets (although less so on walls), without leaving them dripping wet. It stays powerful, no matter how long you use it, and the pull-out scrub brush is good for stubborn areas. There’s a limescale filter too, but you only get steam for around eight minutes and it’s a shame you don’t get accessories for grout, tiles and windows – although there is an additional kit you can buy for that at £40.   This Italian brand has been making pioneering irons and home cleaners since the late 1970s. You’ll be impressed by the steam power as soon as you get this going and we found it worked a treat on everything from kitchen floors to grouting on tiled walls and from sofas to glass. The wheels mean it’s easily manoeuvrable and there’s a wealth of handy accessories including brush, nozzle, squeegee and extension hose, while the large tank means it lasts ages in one go. But the floor takes quite a while to dry afterwards and really deep-rooted stains may need going over a couple of times.   This doesn’t quite have the whistles and bells or power of the more expensive machines in our round-up, but it’s a great budget buy that’s lightweight, robust and easy to store away, as well as heating up in under 15 seconds and providing 15 minutes of continuous steam before the tank needs refilling. The more modest steam levels mean it’s better in handheld mode, although it’s not bad on tiles (but rubbish on carpets), with the exception of really sticky patches and very engrained stains. The wide range of tools includes angle nozzle, upholstery tool, scraper tool and round brush, among others.   Here’s another machine that can be used upright on floors or as a detachable handheld unit. We found it was good at pretty much everything (except removing sticky patches like spilt drinks or sauces) and it doesn’t leave floors really wet. It feels robust and handy accessories include carpet glider, scraper, upholstery head and crevice nozzle. It’s heavier than most, though. If you have hard floors that you struggle to keep clean, we very much doubt you will regret investing in a  . For a cylinder option, we rate the  , although it is pricey, and for a two-in-one machine, we liked the   best, although it’s not brilliant for walls.

" Get your caffeine fix in no time at all with a delicious, cost-effective capsule While nothing can beat a freshly ground cup of coffee in the morning, our hectic schedules mean we might not always have the time. That’s where coffee capsule machines come in.  Offering a great alternative to expensive high-street coffee but far superior to a cup of instant, these machines are both convenient and cost-effective. In fact, one in three households now owns a machine, so it’s clear that we aren’t ready to forgo our daily caffeine fix.  As pod machine ownership continues to grow, more brands are now offering compatible pods so you’re not tied to the manufacturer’s own-brand. Although there are   available, we’ve focused on Nespresso-compatible capsules, as while Dolce Gusto and Tassimo (which have different shaped capsules and different machines) are popular, there are limited alternative capsules aside the manufacturers’ own. You’ll find there’s less coffee in a pod than you get in your local coffee shop, so don’t be afraid to double up for a more authentic taste, and don’t pay too much attention to the strength rating stated – with no consistency between brands, it varies greatly.  To be sure you’re getting the most out of your pods, use filtered tap water (particularly in hard water areas) to stop the coffee tasting flat or bitter.  One of the biggest bug bears of using a coffee pod machine is that your coffee goes colder, quicker. To avoid this, simply warm your cup by running a shot of water before adding the pod. If using milk, that should also be warmed before adding, and ideally use whole milk for a richer, creamier taste.  Avoid capsules with a very dark roast, as these tend to mask the true flavour of the beans meaning brands can cut corners and use lower quality. It’s the difference between a high-street chain coffee and an independent artisan one. So whether you need an energising espresso, a comforting cappuccino or a lazy latte, the team at   has rounded up the best Nespresso-compatible coffee pods your money can buy. Toast only uses ethically-sourced single-origin speciality coffee beans in its pods, all of which are graded by one of only six female graders in the country. She clearly knows her stuff because on a blind taste test between this and a “proper” coffee, we chose this every time. This great value taster pack contains four different blends, but we particularly love the Brazilian blend with tasting notes of milk chocolate, hazelnut and tangerine. Toast recommends you use the espresso setting on your machine as smaller drinks allow for the delicate flavours to really shine through.   Roasted, ground and filled in the UK, Pact sources the coffee beans for its pods directly from an environmentally conscious plantation in Ethiopia. Pact is a subscription service first and foremost, but you can buy one off bags as well. It only does one coffee pod, the Fahem Limu Natural Pod, but it’s an excellent one – the medium-dark roast provides a full mouthfeel with juicy fruits and a balanced acidity. It’s all delivered to your door in a letterbox friendly pack.   These pods are a blend of three different coffee beans sourced from small cooperative farms in southern India. They have been dark roasted for a strong taste but provide a creamy, smooth drink with a long lasting, surprisingly spicy finish. These coffee capsules are fully compostable, so pop them in your recycling bin when you’re done with them. At just under three quid, we think they’re amazing value, too. There are other flavours in the range, included a decaf option. Available for a very limited time, Nespresso has a new twin pack of rare and contrasting coffees from Laos and Kenya. Both are Pure Origin, which means they’ve been sourced from a single farm. The climate of the Bolaven Plateau in southern Laos results in a well-rounded espresso with a hint of acidity, while the Kenyan “Peaberry” has a jammy fruity flavour. Perfect if you’re looking for something a little different from your regular “purple one”.  This capsule from Taylors of Harrogate – which has been in the tea and coffee business for well over a century – is sourced directly from a Rainforest Alliance-certified farm in Huila, famed for being the best coffee-growing region within Colombia. The slow roast results in a great balance of subtle sweetness and refreshing acidity. There are other capsules available in the range, spread across the globe from Brazilian Yellow Bourbon to Indian Karnataka Dark Roast. These aromatic Fairtrade coffee capsules have a slightly sweet note to them, which is naturally found in the medium roast. Expect a hint of acidity, a touch of nuttiness and a squeeze of nectarine on the palette. The Arabica beans are packed shortly after being roasted to lock in the freshest flavour. There are plenty of other flavours in the range, too.   If you normally grab your morning coffee from Starbucks, you might want to consider switching to its capsules for a DIY cuppa (at a fraction of the price). The house blend is the same concoction as was originally created back in 1971 – the first ever on its way to becoming today’s coffee giant. Expect notes of nut and sweet cocoa with a medium roast. If you’re buying in-store, you can grab a free Starbucks recycling bag to store all your pods in. A blend of three Arabica beans from Peru, Mexico and Ethiopia, this lightly roasted style results in a creamy, chocolate biscuit taste with a touch of balanced acidity. Cru blends, roasts and grinds the beans itself and only buys organic produce from ethical farms. It’s best enjoyed as an espresso, so if you tend to add milk we’d advise using two pods. There are six other pods in the range, from Dark Roast to Decaf. The Finca Lerida coffee plantation has won many international awards including World's Best Coffee from the American Specialty Coffee Association, which is where these premium pods get their coffee beans from. What’s clever about Coffee Hat is you can buy add-on “hats”, which enable you to get a frothy milky top, for example. This is a fruity coffee with a chocolate finish.   These pods give a smooth and nutty single-origin coffee with a lovely crema. It’s great value, and ideal if you get through lots of coffee in your house – working out at just 25p a pod. We found the flavour worked well with or without adding milk and there was no need to add sugar. Also in the Sainsbury’s range – Intenso, Lungo and Ethiopian. This was a tough one to call but in the end we had to award our Best Buy to the newbie,  . The young brand has put its heart and soul into sourcing the finest beans on the planet, investing in a highly qualified grader to ensure top quality at every stage. All of the flavours in its range tasted artisanal and unique, holding their own against a shop bought cup of joe. It’s worth mentioning that the extraction time was slower than some other brands, which is intentional, due to the fine grind that’s used. The extended contact with the water draws out more of the delicate flavours of this lightly-roasted speciality beans – so be patient.  Follow IndyBest on   and  We use cookies to enhance your visit to our site and to bring you advertisements that might interest you.

" From cappuccinos to espresso shots, here are the coffee makers that will help satisfy your caffeine fix Whether you like a straight shot of espresso or you prefer turning it into a latte or cappuccino with some fancy milk action, you’ll need a decent coffee maker. There are three main types of espresso makers – a pod or capsule machine, pump espresso maker or bean-to-cup machine. The former involves simply popping a pre-packaged capsule or pod into the machine – when you press the button, it is pierced and hot water is sent through it to produce the espresso.  Pump espresso makers, on the other hand, use a thermostatically controlled boiler which heats the water to its optimum temperature for coffee (between 85˚C and 92˚C), after which it passes through the ground coffee at the correct bar pressure. These machines usually enable you to steam milk too.  Then there’s the bean-to-cup option, which is essentially a pump espresso maker with a built-in grinder. In other words, these automatic machines grind the coffee beans and then run hot water through them. If you go for one of these, make sure you get one with a good grinder and learn how to use it properly – this, as any barista will tell you, is the most important part of espresso making, bar none. Looking for a way to test the perfect cup of espresso? The crema (the foam which settles on the top) should be golden – and to achieve this holy grail of espresso making, don’t forget that you won’t just need a decent machine, but a top-notch coffee blend too. We could blind you with the science of this coffee grinder – a pulse extraction process and 15-bar pressure water pump – but the bottom line is that this Swiss-made machine makes barista-style espresso with golden crema quickly and efficiently. There’s also plenty of choice of strengths, cup sizes and coffee types. It’s compact, with an easy-to-use touch-screen panel.   This is the slimmest machine we came across that can make espresso from ground coffee or pods, making it ideal for small kitchens. The smooth aroma of the espresso (which you can turn into a cappuccino using the milk-frothing arm) is enough to lure even the sleepiest head out of bed in the morning. And you can set preferences with ease, although we did find it’s easy to press the wrong button by mistake.   Here’s another great option for those whose counter space is limited. Using capsules only, it’s also a breeze to use and most importantly, it makes espressos that smell divine and taste rich, with lots of golden crema. It takes very little effort getting to know how to use it and you can operate it practically with your eyes closed – good for those who take a bit of time waking up in the mornings.   The capsules don’t come cheap, but this retro-looking machine (that comes in red, black or white) makes an exceptional cup of coffee, with a tempting aroma, great quality of crema and smooth taste with a good kick, all in less than half-a-minute. The steam pipe works a treat for frothing milk and the controls are simple to use. The only downside is the water tank, which can be tricky to remove for refilling.   If you like your espresso intense, but not bitter, then this machine – which uses ground coffee or pods – is a winner, especially at this price. The steamer makes decent hot frothy milk in case you want to turn your coffee into a cappuccino, and it’s the easiest machine to set up of all the ones we tried, although the milk frother can feel a bit rigid and the coffee could be ever so slightly hotter.    This vintage-looking machine will take pride of place on any worktop, although be warned it’s big. It doesn’t take long to get going and the espresso – which is made from pods or ground coffee – is so hard to fault that even the most discerning coffee connoisseur should be impressed. The milk steamer turns it into delicious cappuccino, although the machine can look messy after use.   Give someone a cup o’joe made from this manual espresso machine (with an attached grinder) and they’ll be in coffee heaven. In fact, the quality is so superb – and the mechanical action so efficient – that some smaller restaurants use them. There’s plenty of automated control for the trickier bits of coffee making, including auto-frother milk settings that make the silkiest lattes and cappuccinos. The only downside is that it’s as huge as the price tag.   This is the least expensive machine in Gaggia’s new bean-to-cup range and it boasts the long-life ceramic adjustable coffee grinder that this brand has become so famous for. Other wow factors include the quick-heat, stainless-steel thermal block boiler, which means you can make several cups of espresso on a run without a long wait in between each, and adds to the long life of the machine. Cleaning is a doddle too.   If the traditional manual coffee making rituals don’t do it for you and you’d rather just push a couple of buttons to get your morning caffeine fix, then this fully automated machine with milk steamer is likely to appeal. We like the large LED screen, while the patented water heating system keeps your coffee – which you can select in different strengths – nice and hot. Be warned it’s noisy when grinding, though.   Like most Dualit appliances, this sophisticated bit of kit has great attention to detail, with beautiful polished stainless steel aesthetics – with a kettle and toaster to match. It’s easy to customise your preferred settings and the crema and temperature are spot-on. Everything that is movable (cup shelf, for example) or removable (water tank and drip tray, for instance) is effortless to work and it works a treat for tea too.    We deliberated about whether to include this capsule-only machine because its forte really lies in its multiple milk foam textures – the first Nespresso machine to do so – which means that you can get creative with flat white, cappuccino, lattes and macchiatos. But because the plain espressos are also so good, we decided to go for it. Speed is a strong point too – both in heating up and in cleaning.   This intuitive machine works like a dream to produce fabulous espressos (among other coffee types) to suit your strength and volume, largely thanks to the 21-bar extraction pressure. It’s been designed to be extremely simple to use and it manages to look clean even when the coffee is ready – a good job if you go for the white finish as it shows up everything. Try its single origin coffee pods if you can afford it – they’re outstanding.   We know it’s a lot to fork out, but the   ticks every box and will last you years if you look after it well.   is even more fabulous, but we’re aware the price tag is more than most can afford. For those who need to drop a few hundred quid and go for a budget option, the   is a blinder of a machine for under £300, while the   is a steal for under £100.

" Whether you want to wake up to the smell of freshly baked bread or just want to seriously impress at your next dinner party, a bread-maker is a useful bit of kit to add to your kitchen repertoire. Even if you’re a star baker, a good machine will make light work of kneading and proving, converting even the most sceptical.   And while there’s no denying it’s pretty easy to pick up a loaf from your local shop, there’s something intensely satisfying about making your own. Some people, particularly those with severe allergies, will also appreciate knowing what’s going into their food. When deciding which machine is for you, think about what type of bread you’ll be making, whether you’d like a viewing window to see what’s going on and how much space you have for the gadget in your kitchen. Although on the whole most machines are quite large, many we tested are capable of kneading pasta, making dough and even creating jam, so bear that in mind if you’re keen to make your machine work harder for you.  And many of these magic boxes come with a delay function, meaning you simply pop the ingredients in and come back to a warm loaf at a time that is convenient for you. Below, writers of the food and drink blog  .co.uk choose the machines they think are the best thing since sliced bread. We love the relatively compact size of this Russell Hobbs machine. Despite being on the smaller side, it can make a loaf up to 1kg and has an impressive 19 settings with three crust options. A measuring cup and spoon are included, as well as a recipe booklet so you’ll be ready to bake straight out of the box. The keep-warm function lets you enjoy warm bread up to an hour after baking too and there’s also a delay timer if you’d prefer to set overnight.    This brand-new model from Panasonic is the Rolls-Royce of bread-makers. Along with touchscreen controls in a sleek, black, stainless steel design, there are a whopping 37 bake and dough programmes to choose from. Those following a gluten-free diet will appreciate that as well as bread you can now create gluten-free cake and pasta too. To ensure you don’t interrupt the perfect dough, there’s also a clever yeast and nut-and-seed dispenser, which releases the extra ingredients at the optimum time (most models require you to add at the beginning). We followed the instructions provided in the recipe booklet to make a classic white loaf with a medium crust. There’s a fast bake time of 120 minutes but we choose the 13-hour delay timer. The machine was silent – so much so that we weren’t 100 per cent certain it was working but the handy countdown function assured us it was (there’s no viewing window). It comes with plastic measuring gadgets to ensure precision and two rotation paddles for different types of bread. There’s the option of medium, large or extra large loafs with either light to dark crusts. All of those functionalities come at a cost, however, and this machine took up a lot of space in our kitchen.   We found the viewing window useful on this machine and the control panel had large easy-to-use buttons. There are 14 different settings to choose from, including whole wheat, French bread, cakes and even a jam function. The booklet also provides recipes for each. Unfortunately when we made a basic white loaf, the kneading paddle got stuck in the bottom, which we could only remove by cutting the loaf in half, slightly spoiling the overall outcome. We’re hopeful that was probably just a one off, and at this price it’s a risk we’re willing to take. If that doesn’t bother you, this model can produce a choice of two sizes – 1.5lb or 2lb – with either light, medium or dark crust options and if you’re not quite ready for it, there’s a handy keep-warm setting.   This basic bread-maker has the ability to make either a 700g or 1kg loaf with a choice of light, medium or dark crusts. There are 15 pre-set programmes, including gluten-free but unfortunately no recipe booklet. Instead it suggests using a bread mix, which felt like cheating but did result in a beautifully golden loaf without any fuss. With a soft middle and chewy crust, the bread slid out of the non-stick pan easily and the large buttons were easy to understand and programme.    Although one of the more basic models we tested, this machine was still capable of making a variety of loaves with 12 preset programmes to choose from (including French bread, wholewheat, quick bread, sweet bread, dessert, dough and bake) as well as three adjustable crust settings. One of our favourite features is the 13-hour delay timer so you can wake up with the beautiful aroma of fresh bread filling the house. The handy viewing window also reassures you that things are ticking along nicely and the LCD display counts down the time remaining.   One for the keen baker, this model took up the most space in our kitchen, but does come with a couple of extra handy gadgets. Firstly the stand allows you to get creative with mini-baguettes or rolls instead of your standard loaf, while the detachable scales fit neatly on top and allow for extra precision. There’s a recipe book included if you’re looking for guidance and an automatic dispenser for a more experimental loaf – we tried sundried tomatoes which worked a treat. There are 12 preset programmes to choose from including an ultra-quick setting – a 700g loaf will cook in 1 hour and 28 minutes. Or if you have longer, there’s the option of a creating a larger 1kg loaf.   This clever little machine can make 500g, 750g, 1kg and 1.25kg loaves – the widest choice from any of the machines we put to the test. The large LCD interface was easy to use, with a turn-dial to make your selection with. Like some of the other premium models, this comes with a chute for adding extra ingredients in at the most appropriate time. There is also the widest variety of crust settings – with light-to-crunchy available. We were very happy with our simple loaf and the kneading paddle didn’t get stuck once.    Super-easy to use, with 19 programmes making everything from bread and pizza dough to cakes and jams, this clever machine also features a drop-down blade for easy removal – no more stuck paddles, hurrah! If you’re in need of bread fast, (we’ve all been there) the fast-bake setting only takes 70 minutes and there’s a recipe book included so you don’t have to wing it. There’s a 12-hour delay function, fruit-and-nut dispenser and viewing window, ticking all of our boxes.    This top-of-the-range bread-maker has a convection fan for a controlled temperature, resulting in an even bake. There’s a handy rapid bake too, which takes just under an hour from start to finish, as well as an all-important dispenser and impressive 15 settings. There’s a recipe booklet to get you started and it’s all displayed in a reasonably quiet, slick, silver box, with easy-to-use touchscreen controls.    Nowadays you don’t need to spend the most dough to get the best results. We were impressed with how hardworking even the cheaper and smaller bread-makers were, creating delicious loaves every time. The   is fantastic value if you’re just getting started, or if you’re not sure how much use your machine will get. If you’re a keen baker, we love the super-quiet  , finding there was little it couldn’t do. The recipe booklet was especially useful for beginners, too.

" Create a smoothie, sauce or soup in seconds with the help of this compact kitchen gadget Named after their shape, bullet blenders are the ideal kitchen gadget for whipping up smoothies, sauces and soup. They’re normally compact (compared to   and  ) and fit into tight spaces on your kitchen counter, saving you the faff of having to unpack and repack them from a cupboard with each use.  They come into their own though during a busy morning routine. Smoothies can be created in a few minutes – that includes everything from chucking the ingredients in the cup, blending and doing the washing up, with most models coming with additional sip-lids so you can drink them on-the-go.  Because of this though, most blending cups cater for one or two people max, so if you’re blending for the whole family this may not be the quickest option for you.  We tested bullet blenders on how quickly they crushed fruit, tough veg and ice (if at all), how easy they are to clean and use, and whether they come with useful accessories or extra settings.  In our opinion, NutriBullet is still top when it comes to making healthy drinks and smoothies. For the price, you expect more for your money and its latest design delivers. Although slightly bigger than other models, the base unit is strong and sturdy, with super-sticky pads on the bottom. You get two large cups (930ml and 820ml) – one is insulated to keep your drink cool and the large cup sizes mean the NutriBullet is ideal if you’re blending for a family. The blade does a great job of breaking down fruit, veg, stems, seeds and ice, and isn’t as noisy as many we tested.  There’s also new, built-in smart tech where the model knows when to speed up, slow down and turn off automatically for optimum nutrient extraction. Although we couldn’t test extraction, it left our juice with a smooth consistency. There’s also a top tips and recipe guide, which we found the most useful of the bunch.   Put anything from celery and kale to ice and frozen fruit in this blender and it will reduce it to a refreshing smoothie in less than 30 seconds. It’s simple to use: just place your ingredients in the cup, attach the blade lid and place in the base unit. Select the programme you want – “Blend” for softer ingredients or “Ultra-blend” for pulses and frozen food – and the Nutri Ninja will kick into action, with the countdown screen showing how long is left before your juice is ready. The pulse option will only work while that button is pressed down and the start/stop button is for those who want to control blending time (with a count-up timer), although you can stop the blender on any of the settings using this button. It’s a clever machine that comes with extra dishwasher-safe cups and sip-lids, as well as an inspiration guide. It’s a little noisy though, but that’s common with this style of blender. Overall, it’s well worth shelling out for, if you have the budget.    Designed especially for smoothie or juice making, this model comes with two 750ml cups and sport-cap lids so you can take your creation to work or the gym with ease. To use: fill the cup with your ingredients, attach blade lid, line up the padlock on the lid to the arrow on the base unit and turn on at the mains. Turn the dial to “I” to blend, “II” for a more powerful blend or “P” to pulse – return the dial to “0” once your smoothie is at the right consistency. The unit shakes more than most, especially on “II” setting but it created a smooth consistency in less than 30 seconds. It’s super-easy to clean too and looks good on your kitchen surface.   This is a simple and effective machine, which we found dealt easily with soft fruit and oats, making smoothies of a drinkable consistency within 10 seconds or so. It also didn’t have a problem with frozen fruit, ice or nuts. There are two different blending glasses (550ml or 800ml) and two blades (cross and flat), although the flat blade, for oats, nuts and seeds, only fits onto the smaller cup. To use the machine, fill up your chosen cup, screw on the blade lid, turn it upside down and slot it into the blender, turning it clockwise slightly and pushing down. Once it’s done, the cups can be used to drink from on-the-go, which is handy for cutting down on washing up. It can be very loud, however, and it gives off a mechanical smell on the first couple of uses, although this doesn’t affect the taste.   This is a powerful yet easy-to-use machine. The one-litre blending cup means you can make more than enough smoothie for the whole family and put the rest in the fridge for later. Alternatively, you can pour it into one of the other two cups provided, which feature easy-drink lids for when you're out and about. A handy booklet featuring 50 simple recipes is also included, which is ideal if you're new to making smoothies and juices or just feeling stuck for inspiration. Our favourite aspect though is the powerful motor. With 1200 watts and a six blade attachment, it liquidised our ingredients (including ice) in roughly thirty seconds. Add to that the fact that all the cups are dishwasher safe, this machine is certainly a desirable option for cutting down prep times.   This streamlined blender is best suited to those who drink smoothies on-the-go. It’s a basic blender – add the ingredients and the blade lid, line up the arrow on the cup to the base unit, push down and twist to start blending. For softer ingredients you won’t have to wait more than 30 seconds to make a smoothie. It struggled slightly with pulses and harder veg – we had to shake the container to get the blade to work over these trickier ingredients. The two “Cool Tubes” you get with this blender though add to the appeal of taking the cups on your commute. You fill the tubes up with water and leave to freeze overnight. Then you can attach them to your cup lids when you’re taking your juice out the house. Don’t expect them to keep your drink ice cold but it certainly delayed them getting lukewarm in our bag. For those on a budget, this is a great option.    Gym fiends will like this one as you get two transportable 600ml bottles for those all-important smoothies or shakes. It’s super-easy to set up, there are two speed settings and you whizz up your concoction in one of the bottles, swap the blade for the lid and on you go. We found it really efficient making our breakfast smoothie, consisting of soft fruit, yoghurt and oats. It tackled the likes of carrots and frozen fruit too, though admittedly not quite as efficiently as some more powerful machines on the list (you might need to do a bit of stopping and shaking). It’s compact and easy to clean but you might need a brush to get all the way to the bottom. For this price though, we were impressed.    This simple blender from TV chef James Martin is another easy-to-use machine. Fill the cup with your ingredients, attach the blade lid, line up the arrows on the base unit and cup and push down to blend. We found you had to keep it pushed down yourself, so you can’t get on with something else while it’s in action. It’s also designed for softer fruit and veg so don’t expect it to crush everything you throw at it. But we think this model is best for someone wanting to make regular smoothies and is on a smaller budget. The blender looks stylish on your worktop, has dishwasher safe parts and comes with a James Martin recipe booklet for extra inspiration.    The   is a close second but the winner has to be the   for a sleek, stylish model that produces smoothies and juices in seconds.

" Fry up a feast without any of the fat or faff of hot oil with an efficient air-cooking machine The idea behind air fryers is healthier, lower-fat cooking. Combining hot air, rather like a fan oven, and a very small amount of oil the way they cook is a world away from deep-fat fryers which submerge the food in the fat and pile on the calories. But it’s important to get the right air fryer as poor ones can leave you with soggy, bland food at the bottom of the machine – and sometimes throughout – and you can also wind up with a machine that is difficult to work or clean. First off, consider the capacity – you don’t want to wind up with a machine that’s too small (or big) for your family. Check the space the machine takes up – they come in all shapes and sizes and can take up a lot of room on your worktop. Do you want it to be able to do more than fry? Some machines multitask and are able to grill, roast and reheat – sometimes even more besides. Does it allow you to cook two different types of food at once, such as steak and chips? Is it easy to set up? How simple are the controls to use? And finally, are the parts dishwasher-safe – and do you need them to be?  If you’ve got a lot of mouths to feed, this is easily the best of the bunch. It’s fast with user-friendly controls and makes tasty fodder, whether it’s chicken breasts or chips, after which you can pop the parts in the dishwasher. You’ll need some serious space as it’s huge, but that means it is able to cook 1.7kg of food – that’s about eight portions of chips. On the downside, it hums and the outside can get hot. This is a bargain and has a fresh, modern design with digital display and clear lid so you can monitor the cooking progress. Cooking up to 800g of food in the non-stick basket, it does a decent job of frying, baking, grilling, roasting and reheating – although the crispiness of food on the outside isn’t quite on par with pricier models. But it comes up cleaner than some of its more expensive contemporaries when washing by hand or in the dishwasher. This has long been a bestseller in the US but has only just arrived in the UK. We like it because of its airflow technology. With many other devices, food in the basket is only cooked from the top down, so you get more browning towards the top, while food at the bottom can be soggy or sometimes not even cooked through. This one, however, circulates air all around the basket at a constant speed. With a three-litre capacity, it feeds three to four and you can bung the parts in the dishwasher.   We found this smart-looking machine easy to use, thanks to the intuitive LCD display, and the automatic switch-off makes it relatively low-maintenance too, while the 4.5-litre capacity is enough for a large family. Food cooks well, although the chips don’t come up quite as crispy on the outside as with more expensive machines. It’s quite quiet and easy to clean but it is heavy, so not something to invest in if you intend to store it away when not in use. If you want your food in a hurry but don’t want to spend out on a premium machine, this is a good buy. It takes just over 30 minutes to produce chips – and they are delicious, as long as you stir them regularly. It cooks meat evenly too (again, be sure to turn it over) and it’s roomy enough for 1.5kg of food. It has a viewing window but can be clunky to operate. This has most of the benefits of the Tefal Actifry Express XL – low maintenance, particularly good chips – and to top it all, it has a handy second compartment that sits above the main bowl, so you can cook your meat and chips at the same time. But it’s slightly smaller with a 1.5kg capacity and not quite as quick. Plus it has the same downsides – in that the top can get hot. It’s noisy and is a mammoth bit of kit. Here’s another one where you need to stir regularly to get good results but if you’re happy to do this, it’s an excellent choice, which can air-fry and grill up to 1.25kg of food with half a tablespoon of oil. It’s noticeably quieter than most other machines we tested and all the parts are easy to both operate and clean (it’s dishwasher proof). But the controls could be more user-friendly. We’re a bit confused why this is called ‘XL’ when it is 3.2-litre capacity but it does tick all the right boxes – quick, easy to work, simple to clean and it’s also versatile as it air fries, grills, bakes, sautées and roasts, with seven preprogrammed cooking functions and automatic shut-off. Available in black or red. Another multitasker, this can fry, bake, roast and grill and is 20 per cent smaller than its predecessor (yet still with 800g capacity – enough for four), with dishwasher-safe parts that we found came out looking like new every time. The food comes out just as you’d hope, including chips that are crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside – and it’s a good size for a small family. We have some minor niggles, including the fact that the instructions aren’t great and the recipe book could be more comprehensive, but none of them are deal-breakers.  We fell in love with the  , which is a dream to work and produces delicious crispy foods, although if you want something smaller, the   is another fantastic buy. We have a few very slight grumbles about both but nothing that stops us making them our top recommendations.  Follow IndyBest on   and  We use cookies to enhance your visit to our site and to bring you advertisements that might interest you.

" Whizz, whisk, chop and slice with the minimum of fuss thanks to a multi-tasking machine If chopping, slicing, blending, mixing and whisking are the bane of your life, it’s time to invest in a food processor. But while all of them claim to make fast and light work of food preparation tasks like this – leaving you with of finely sliced carrots, creamy mayonnaise or perfectly whisked egg-whites – the reality is often very different. So we have worked our way through machine after machine, changing attachment after attachment, making everything from curries to cakes and sauces to salads. These are the nine that made the cut. When buying your food processor, don’t be led purely by price. It may be that a budget model meets your needs, particularly if you don’t cook in large quantities and/or only need occasional usage. Also be sure to think carefully about what attachments you need. Most machines chop, slice, grate and mix, but not all of them whisk, whip and knead. Also consider if you want an extra blender attachment – not all of them have it. Make sure the machine is easy to keep clean as the time you save in food prep may be made up for in washing up. And decide if you want to keep it out on the worktop (good if you’ll use it regularly) or store it away (for more occasional use). For the former, you’ll need to check you have enough space for the machine (including vertically – food processors can be a tight squeeze under overhead cabinets) and for the latter, make sure it’s not too big and heavy – and that it has a box for the attachments.  Other things to consider are the size of the feeding tube; capacity and number of bowls (many come with a mini bowl too); how powerful the machine is; the noise levels; overall quality of the parts; and finally, the customer service of the manufacturer in case something does go wrong. 1.   £120, John Lewis  It’s hard to believe this compact and relatively cheap machine can pack in over 50 functions including slicing, grating, chopping and blending – and it’s pretty quiet too. A great all-rounder for smaller kitchens, it has accessories that can be stored away neatly and are easy to slot in – although be careful of the blades, which are razor-sharp and it’s not as fast as the more expensive machines in our round-up.   2.   £371, Amazon   This swanky-looking machine, with its glass touchscreen panel and five automatic programmes, will look right at home in any hi-tech kitchen. A good job, really, as it’s so big and heavy that you’ll probably have to leave it on the worktop. It’s exceptional at whisking, whipping and grating, although slicing and pureeing are slightly less impressive. Be prepared to keep schtum when it’s on as it sounds like a freight train.   3.   £65, Amazon   You get a lot of bang for your buck with this versatile bit of kit that includes a blender, mini chopper, juicer and grinder, along with oodles of blades, whisks and more – all of which take the elbow grease out of preparing smaller batches of foods. On the downside, many customers complain that the plastic can be prone to splitting, although if anything does go wrong, the customer service is second-to-none.   4.  £300, John Lewis   This fancy machine promises you the world and actually, it pretty much delivers it – in the culinary sense anyway. The blending, chopping, grating and slicing functions are particularly great and the extra-wide food chute comes in handy, as does the fact that the parts and bowl are dishwasher-friendly. But it weighs a tonne and is ever so slightly less fast and comprehensive than the Magimix and KitchenAid.   5.   £35, Amazon   We love this little 10-speed machine, whose force is so mighty that you feel there’s nothing it couldn’t blitz through, even on the middle settings. Our tests in chopping, mixing, slicing and shredding all produced top results, although it can take the patience of a saint to lock the bowl and lid into place correctly and the quality of the plastic isn’t the best – but it’s as you’d expect as such a low price.   6.   £350, John Lewis   The daddy of all food processors, this is as good as having your personal sous chef. Blending, mincing, mashing, dicing, kneading and grating are just a few of the tasks this large capacity machine embraces with ease and finesse. We particularly love the ability to change the slicing thickness and the different-sized feeding tubes. Faults? Well, none really, except for the eye watering price-tag.   7.   £125, John Lewis   A great worktop companion for smaller kitchens, this machine takes up no more room than a mini processor, but is surprisingly powerful and quiet. It’s a star when it comes to everyday chopping, puréeing and blending, but slicing and grating are not its forte and it doesn’t whisk or whip. Nor is it the fastest, but it’s lightweight, if you do need to store it away.   8.   £69, John Lewis Another strong contender for bijou kitchens, this is a simple, cheap and small model with two speed settings. It does a grand job at chopping, mixing, kneading, grating, slicing and blending, but whisking and whipping is poor and you can’t store the attachments away. For Mary Berry wannabes, for whom whisking and whipping is a must, consider its big sister, the FPM250, which also looks more swish.   9.   from £282, Amazon Jamie Oliver uses the word Magimix synonymously with the term food processor – a reminder that this brand was responsible for the UK’s first ever models. This one has been made with keen cooks in mind, working quickly and quietly through large quantities and excelling at every task, thanks to the 13 accessories (including three different-size bowls, an egg whisk and a citrus press). It’s ridiculously heavy, though, and it would be even better if it had variable speeds.     We can’t quite believe the   comes in at the price it d oes, given the quality and versatility. But if you want something even more comprehensive and upmarket, both the   and   are an absolute dream to work with if you have cash to splash. (If you prefer glass and want slightly bigger capacity, go for KitchenAid; while the Magimix is slightly quieter and feels just a bit more powerful). The   certainly lives up to its name if you can’t stretch to over £300. Meanwhile, at the budget end, it’s the   that gets the biggest thumbs up from us.

" Whip up a storm in the kitchen with a device that makes light work of sauces, smoothies and soups Soups, smoothies, sauces – there’s a lot you can do with a hand blender. And compared to a traditional jug blender, they can be a lot more convenient too: simply stick it into your pan and away you go. Hand blenders take up less space in your kitchen, create less washing up and mean there's no food wastage – it’s always a pain not being able to get the final dregs out of a jug blender. But a lot of today's hand blenders are much more than just a stick. Lots come with mini food processor and whisk attachments too, which while giving you multiple appliances in one, are also not as dinky as you might want. A decent blender should be powerful, not too loud and tidy too – a lot of the ones out there spray food and drink up the walls of your kitchen and are so loud they’d wake your neighbours, let alone your family and housemates.  By making endless soups, smoothies, dips and sauces, we tested over a dozen hand blenders to find the very best of the bunch. 1.   £129.99, John Lewis With six different attachments, there’s very little this blender can’t do. It can also be a masher, a whisk, a chopper and a grinder. It’s incredibly versatile but also easy to use – all you have to do is switch attachments, which is a simple procedure. The blender is also really powerful and had no problems powering through frozen fruit to make a smoothie or chunky veg to create a velvety soup. As you’d expect from the price and its 1000W motor, it’s one of the most powerful and efficient on the market.  2.   £28, Amazon This blender is simple in every sense – there’s only one attachment and speed, and it’s very easy to use. Although it doesn’t come with many extra parts, it does come with a small blending jug. It’s big enough to make a smoothie for one so would be great for someone on a budget who wants to make a liquid breakfast in the morning – the blender whizzed up a banana milkshake effortlessly. Unfortunately however, it’s not the most stable – we don’t recommend leaving the blender standing up in the jug as you're likely to end up with spilt milkshake (which is almost definitely worth crying over). 3.  £199, John Lewis This is part of the Artisan range which is best known for its stylish, retro-inspired stand mixer. This cordless hand blender stands out from the pack as you’re free to blend away from an electric socket. It has a little removable charger but you do have to wait a little while for it to charge up though, which could be annoying if you want soup and you want it now. To fully charge the battery takes three hours, but that then lasts just as long without recharging. Available in three colours – red, cream or silver – the design is stylish and sleek. It has five different speeds and comes with three interchangeable stainless steel blades, a whisk and a mini food-chopper. Easy to use, it blended chunky soup without a problem, which you’d expect from the price. The blender itself may be on the heavy side but it comes with a handy case for keeping all the parts together. 4.   £58.49, Lakeland With a handy bag to keep all the parts together and a slick stainless steel design, this is a practical option. With various attachments allowing you to blend, chop and whisk, you get a lot for your money and can use this for the likes of soups and cake mixes. It’s powerful with its 800W motor and will whizz up a soup in no time (quicker than some of the less powerful blenders), just make sure you have enough in the pan as we get some splashing. The speed is changed with a dial which allows you to control the power easily. It also comes with a blending jug, mini food processor and whisk.  5.   £79.95, Amazon This sleek, modern-looking blender comes with measuring jugs, a chopper bowl and whisk attachment too, allowing you to puree baby food and whip up meringues as well as blend smoothies and soups. With a dial to increase the power, this one effectively blended up both chunky apple and frozen banana, creating a perfectly smooth smoothie. It looks more expensive compared to others of a similar price, and despite being one of the least powerful at 700W, worked effectively. 6.   £38, Amazon What’s unique about this blender is its precision control trigger – the harder you press the button, the faster it goes, which makes it easy to increase power and speed. What’s more, it also has eight speeds and a turbo boost, which seemed powerful despite its relatively low 650W. Another distinguishing feature of this blender is its anti-splash head – we were impressed to find it really didn’t splatter at all. As part of a set with attachments that allow you to mash and chop too, it’s good value for money. Unfortunately it’s not particularly stylish. 7.   £74, AO.com Slightly different to the other blenders in the list, this one can be a little fiddly as it requires pressing two buttons at once, though it does allow you to increase the speed by squeezing the handle. It’s relatively quiet for a blender and has a simple but pleasing design. Another one with various attachments, the chopper and blending tools are easily interchanged – it made light work of hummus and crushed ice when we tested it. 8.   £36, Amazon This is a stripped-back blender – no jug, no different attachments, just a very effective stick blender which is priced accordingly. Even on its lowest setting, the 750W blender is very powerful – it has a turbo setting, but we didn’t need to use it to whip up smoothies or soups. You turn the dial on the top to increase and decrease the power, which is simple to do mid-blend. It’s not up there in the looks stakes, but the stainless steel casing wouldn’t look offensive in most kitchens. It does the job and it does it well. Largely for its incredible versatility, the   gets our vote. Considering it’s effectively six appliances in one, it works out as great value. That said, if all you really want is a hand blender, the   may be the way to go.

" Keep your healthy-eating goals on track with a versatile kitchen helper A good blender can make all the difference when it comes to making soups, smoothies, milkshakes, sauces and purees. Professional-grade ones, such as Vitamix and Blendtec, move into   territory too, managing to chop veg, mill grains, crush ice and heat soup. Your first decision is whether to go for a jug blender, soup maker, smoothie maker or a smaller bullet blender  If you want a machine for quick and convenient one-portion smoothies and milkshakes, using whole fruit and veg, our advice is to go for a   as the taps on smoothie makers can easily clog up. Some bullet blenders mill nuts and seeds too. If, on the other hand, you’re a soup enthusiast, consider a soup maker which enables you to both cook and blend your soup all at the same time, thanks to the heating element on the bottom. That leaves the traditional jug blender, which is far and away your best option if you want a good all-rounder machine for all these things, and more.  Don’t assume you always get what you pay for or that the greater the power, the better the blender. We found some of the cheapest machines and/or with the least power excel at certain tasks that some fancier models struggle with. Instead, start with your needs and match them to the machine, using our guide below. Consider whether you want a glass (sturdier but heavier) or plastic jug and how easy it is to use. Does it have variable speeds for better blending control? Are there programmes for specific ingredients, such as ice crushing? Are the parts dishwasher friendly? Is the blade easy to cut yourself on or is it well-protected? Do you want extra jugs and blades? And is it lightweight, with cord-storage included, if you need to store it away between uses? In this round-up, we’ve tested jug blenders across all budgets and brands – creating everything from iced drinks to sauces including pesto, and from butternut squash soup to smoothies with raw foods such as ginger, kale and celery.  1.   £249, UK Juicers  If you’re desperate for a Vitaxmix or Blendtec (see number 9 and 7) but if just can’t justify the price tag of a professional-grade blender, this is an affordable alternative, blitzing foods with its eight-pronged blade which draw ingredients into the middle of the machine. Even raw foods like kale don’t pose a challenge and we found it was good with dry ingredients too, milling grains and grinding seeds with the ease it promises. Available in silver or white. 2.   £159.99, Amazon  This classy and compact looking blender comes in a range of colours, and aesthetics aren’t all it’s got going for it, with no unwanted lumps spoiling the smooth finish of your culinary creations – even when it comes to ice, which is often a sticking point for blenders. It’s quiet, easy to keep clean and the new BlendCup – available separately – means you can turn it into a bullet blender. The recipe book is great, but the machine is heavy. 3.   £49.99, Argos The one thing most blenders struggle with making is pesto, but despite the low price tag, this one does it really well, revealing its capabilities when it comes to both wet and dry ingredients. We also found it good for soups and smoothies and even ice. It’s a doddle to set up – including the extra grinder attachment – and the glass jug is built to last. But it’s not the fastest and as you need to wash the blade by hand, be sure to have your marigolds at the ready. 4.  £299.95, John Lewis  You’ll be hard pushed to make a smoother smoothie, puree or soup (which, by the way, you can reheat afterwards) than with this powerful machine, all thanks to the patented blade and bowl system. The five pre-set programmes and 12 speeds means it’s got most ingredients and recipes covered, although be warned it’s loud. And while it’s not the cheapest of machines, it’s actually fifty quid cheaper than it was a year ago. 5.   £85.42, Amazon  You might need a bit of patience with this one, which isn’t the quickest at blending, but the super-smooth results are worth it and it’s pretty quiet too, as well as being simple to use and good value for money. Philips says it’s the off-centre blade jug that creates the desired consistency – in which case, it’s a damn fine invention. 6.  £149.95, John Lewis With a mammoth seven colours to choose from – including our favourite, the pastel pink – this retro-look compact blender will make an eye-catching addition to your worktop and it’s nice and light too. No need to bore yourself with lengthy instructions as it’s a doddle to use straight from the box and it’s great for everyday smoothie and soups, although we don’t rate it for dryer ingredients or frozen fruits or indeed for being quick. 7.  £499, Amazon There’s nothing this American industrial-spec machine doesn’t breeze through, which is why many restaurants and smoothie bars also use them. The blades are dull (so no cutting yourself), as well as being far thicker and stronger than most, and are designed to suck the ingredients down, rather than sending them around the jar. It’s easy to clean (one drop of washing-up liquid and press the clean cycle), almost impossible to break and there’s an eight-year warranty (longest in the industry). But it is noisy. 8.  £101.26, Amazon Every blender claims to have some magic bullet to super-smooth results and with this one, it’s a multi-layered blade. We found it excelled at everything – including vegetables, nuts and the acid test of crushing ice – and it doesn’t make too much noise in the process. Not the best machine if you’re in a hurry though or if you don’t like cleaning as the parts can’t go in the dishwasher. 9.  £449, Lakeland The Americans know a thing or two about blending, with this US brand making some of the best known blenders on the planet. This one makes lump-free creations using every ingredient we tried in record time and it’s hugely versatile, with 10 speed settings and a genuinely handy DVD and cookbook, along with a seven-year warranty. While not as loud as previous machines in the range, it could still be quieter. 10.  £34.99,  This machine is half price until the end of January, so snap one up if it takes your fancy. The illuminated controls give a smart look and it creates lump-free smoothies and soups in under a minute – very quick for a blender at this price. Removing the jug can be fiddly at first, but you soon get the knack. However, be warned it’s heavy and quite loud.  and   both come in at under £300, yet they still have a professional feel and are easily good enough for keen cooks (Sage is quicker; L’Equip excels at raw ingredients). Few people have a grand to throw at a blender, but if you know you’ll use it every day and want fast and faultless results, as well as durability and longevity,   is an incredible bit of kit. At half the price, the   is still expensive, but certainly more than half as good. And at the budget end,   is a bargain for under £50.

" Whip up a healthy, delicious concoction with an efficient machine There are two main types of juicer – centrifugal (the most popular and the cheapest) and masticating (also known as cold press or slow juicers). Centrifugal machines shred ingredients with their toothed blades on the bottom of a spinning sieve with a force that separates the juice from the pulp. They often have two speeds for hard or soft fruits and veg, while pricier ones sometimes also enable you to juice particularly soft fruits like berries – something that more affordable models tend to struggle with. Centrifugal juicers generally tend to be smaller than masticating ones and work quickly. Some don’t even require you to chop fruit and veg up first. But they’re not your best option if you want to juice greens, wheatgrass and (in most cases) very soft fruits like berries – which is where masticating juicers come into their own. These machines crush fruit and veg using slowly rotating gears (augers) that press out the juice through a punctured screen. There’s little they can’t juice and some machines doing other kitchen tasks too, such as grinding coffee and mincing. But be warned: they are slower, and often trickier to clean. A high speed centrifugal juicer with a large feeding chamber such as the   can take as little as five minutes to prepare and produce a pint of juice, as well as clean it up afterwards. Vertical slow juicers will take a bit longer – say, 10 minutes – and horizontal masticating juicers a bit longer again.  You should be able to get two or three pints out of a typical juicing session, but there’s no reason why you can’t make more and just empty the pulp bin a few times during the process.  Whichever type you go for, try and get one with dishwasher friendly parts and remember not all juicers come with their own jug. A drop-stop spout and extra-large feed chute are handy extras, and do remember to check whether you need to peel and cut your fruit before feeding them in.  When it comes to extracting the optimum amount of juice from veg and fruit, you’ll be hard pushed to find anything that beats this dual-speed machine, especially in this price range. It whizzes through whole fruit like pears and apples and the juice is smooth. Plus, the machine – which is pretty quiet compared to others – is a breeze to use, largely thanks to the wide chute. It’s easy to clean up afterwards, with dishwasher-safe parts. Juice geeks, rejoice – here’s a machine that extracts juice from veggies and greens, ranging from beetroot to kale, turning them into full-bodied, flavoursome drinks time after time. Yes, you pay more, but cheaper machines just don’t tend to cut the mustard with these ingredients, whereas this one creates delicious and healthy juice variations without any annoying froth and it is robust, as well as easy to set up, use and clean. You can even run the pulp back through the machine to get more juice. This is outstanding value for a two-speed machine that makes super smooth fruit juice. It’s easy to set up and use, it works quickly and isn’t hard to clean. We also found it’s the gift that keeps on giving because turning it off seems to prompt extra juice to flow out. It’s pretty noisy and struggles with veg, but that’s not unusual, and the chute could be wider. But these are minor niggles, when you consider the price. “Can I have a glass?” “And me.” “Me too.” If this is the kind of conversation that goes on round your breakfast table, then this one-speed machine – which makes large quantities of juice quickly and quietly – will do you proud, leaving practically bone-dry pulp, which is always a good sign of an efficient juicer. The parts aren’t dishwasher safe, but it’s easy enough to take apart and wash up in the sink. You realise just how good this machine is when you test it next to some of its rival machines that cost twice as much. Not only is it significantly sturdier, but it’s powerful and quick and the resulting juice – of which you get loads, both from whole fruit and veg – is delicious and just the right consistency. On the downside, it’s a clunky, heavy machine that takes a bit of time to get to know how to use and it’s not the easiest to clean. This compact machine – which is available in several colours – makes a great addition to smaller kitchens. And it doesn’t stop at making juice, thanks to its frozen attachment which means it can create cold desserts such as smoothies and sorbets too. We found it worked quickly and efficiently, but it takes a while to get to know how to use it and the feed hole is narrow, so you’ll need to cut up fruit and veg first. Purists may claim this isn’t technically a juicer, but the fact is that some people really only want a machine for citrus fruit. We found it whizzed through everything from lemons to grapefruits with ease and every last drop is extracted. We also like the option of fine or coarse filter, depending on whether you want juice with or without bits. Parts are dishwasher safe and it doesn’t take up too much space. You can choose whether you want thick or clear juice with this clever machine that that gets top marks for extracting juice quickly and proficiently, largely thanks to the extra-large feeding tube, which eats up large veg and fruits with no need to pre-cut. Unlike most machines, it doesn’t drip afterwards and the quick rinse function works wonders when it comes to cleaning up. Here’s another machine that’s great for feeding the masses as it makes a lot of juice at speed. It’s also a winner if you don’t want to wake everyone up while you’re preparing it because it’s pretty quiet. Of all the machines we tested, it made the best orange juice hands down and it did quite well with tougher ingredients like carrots too. We’d have preferred a wide feeding chute and easier-to-follow instructions, but neither are deal breakers.  The   isn’t the latest model from Braun, but it’s our favourite centrifugal juicer because it makes short work of whole fruits, making it quick to use, and it’s easy to work and clean up afterwards. For masticating juicers, our top choice is the  , which extracts juice from veggies and greens far more efficiently than other models that are even more expensive.

" Want dinner in a matter of minutes? We put the latest machines to the test Even a basic supermarket microwave oven will reheat a cup of coffee or cook a spud. But how will these things taste? We tested a selection of microwaves and combis to find the ones that delivered the best results as well as high-speed convenience. There’s no minimum (or maximum) wattage to look for but more watts will translate into faster cooking, so if you use your microwave a lot then it’s worth aiming for 900W or more.  Some models simply microwave food well. Others combine it with a grill or grill and oven. Many have built-in recipes with menus that walk you through each step. And some newer models boast foodie functions like steam cooking or a crisper plate. Crisper plates are a relatively new innovation. The grill cooks from above while microwaves heat the metal pan, to cook food from below. This lets you cook food like pizzas, pies and quiches quickly and efficiently with underside nice and crisp instead of floppy. The other interesting trend is for flatbed designs instead of turntables. This increases the usable capacity and means you can reheat food in big rectangular oven dishes. Turntables help ensure evenness but the latest tech goes a long way to ensuring that flatbed models cook evenly too. Capacity-wise anything below 20 litres feels cramped but that’s ok if your microwave cooking needs are small. More importantly, measure your dinner plates and don’t buy a model with a turntable that’s any smaller – we all have nights when we need to reheat dinner. If you’re keen to try steam cooking but want a freestanding microwave, this is a great buy. It has a large (27-litre) capacity with a flatbed design and features a combi grill and steam oven as well as 1000W microwave. Steam makes for succulent meat and fish, nutrient-packed veggies and we found that it even improved our cake baking. Its full-width shelf gives you extra oven space and it also comes with a crisper-pan, perfect for pizzas, pies and quiches, which are cooked better and faster than with a conventional oven. Fab for foodies. A generous 40-litre capacity, 900W microwave, this has a huge array of programs and built-in recipes, as well as lots of accessories. The lot combines to make this integrated microwave-grill combi a great choice if you’re redoing your kitchen. The 30 pre-programmed recipes were a doddle to use: they set the time, temperature and power level for you. You can also grill, cook with steam or use the crisper plate not just for pizzas and pies but as a healthy alternative to frying eggs, bacon and more.  A rounded back makes this compact 700W microwave the perfect fit for corners. Features are simple, just a microwave with five power levels. There’s no combi or crisper pan and at 13 litres it’s a bit small inside. But it magically shoehorns in a respectable 28cm glass turntable. It did a great job of the basics and takes up precious little space. This affordable 900W microwave with grill-oven combi punches well above its weight. There are plenty of cooking programs – we particularly liked the “grill bacon” function – and the styling is reminiscent of pricier rivals. A flatbed design, instead of a turntable, helps maximise cooking space so all of its 25 litre capacity is useable. And its crisper tray did a great job of cooking frozen pizzas: quick, tasty and no soggy bottom. Not quite as cheap as chips, but this is much better than the unbranded microwaves you can pick up in the supermarket aisles. It’s compact (20 litres) with a 25.5cm glass turntable that’s no good for big dinner plates. There’s no combi grill or oven but the 800W microwave’s performance was very impressive and it has built-in programs for popular foods.  Sage has a reputation for reimagined kitchen electricals that promise special functions for foodies, backed by Heston Blumenthal. This 25-litre 1000W microwave-grill combi is no different. We loved the row of extra buttons just inside the door for popular uses, including melting chocolate and softening butter. Plus there’s a huge menu of recipes for less confident chefs: from entire dishes to toasting nuts on its crisper pan. Its large (31cm) turntable is good for big plates, perfect for entertaining.  Here’s another good budget buy. This 800W microwave doesn’t feature an oven or grill, but we liked its contemporary black design and found its cooking performance to be good for the price. It offers a 23-litre capacity with a 29cm turntable. And like all Samsung microwaves, it boasts a ceramic interior that’s hard-wearing, scratch-resistant and anti-bacterial. This makes it easier to clean and more hygienic. If you don’t need all mod cons but you want your appliance to look the business, this is the microwave for you. The industrial design borrows from premium models, with a black mirror-finish door and flatbed design that maximises its 23-litre cooking space. There’s no oven or grill but we found its 800W microwave cooked and defrosted well, perhaps in part thanks to its “diamond cavity” design with textured walls that reflect microwaves in all directions. Bosch is better known for integrated microwaves but this freestanding model has a clever trick up its sleeve: it can be mounted on the underside of a kitchen cabinet, so you can use the valuable worktop space below it. It’s therefore small (17 litres, 24.5cm turntable) so that it’s not too heavy. The 800W microwave is well featured and feels well built, with direct buttons for all five power settings and a rotary knob that pops out to select cooking time. This compact microwave looks great in hip copper with a mirrored glass door. Its 20-litre capacity and 27cm turntable are on the small side (not good for large dinner plates) and there’s no grill or oven, just a microwave with five power levels, but it cooks evenly and features include some nice touches. For example, we liked the way that it beeped several minutes later to remind us when we forgot to remove our food. If you’re going freestanding, then the   is unbeatable thanks to its large capacity and foodie features ranging from a crisper pan to steam cooking. For anyone lucky enough to be designing a new kitchen, we recommend an integrated microwave combi and the   is the best of the bunch. As well as saving worktop space, going integrated buys you much more capacity and your microwave doubles as a second conventional oven, perfect for keen cooks and entertaining.  Follow IndyBest on   and  We use cookies to enhance your visit to our site and to bring you advertisements that might interest you.

" Get the whole family feasting on a delicious, nutritious meal, without any of the hassle First available in the 1970s, the slow cooker was a kitchen gadget that quickly became a must-have for people who wanted a convenient way to produce tasty meals at a low cost and with minimal effort. Now, they’re back in fashion. With slow cookers costing anywhere from around a tenner up to a whopping £100, it can be hard to know where to start. The bottom line is that some cheaper models do the basic task of slow cooking just as well as the fancy machines – it’s just that they don’t have extra features such as a timer, digital controls, keep-warm function and inner bowl that can be used on the hob first. That said, some of the more expensive models can feel better-made and see you through more years of slow cooking. When considering what size you need, remember that even if it promises 5L capacity, you won’t get five litres’ worth of dinner out of it. That’s because you can’t fill it to the top, with the usable cooking space generally around two-thirds of the stated capacity. As a general rule of thumb, a 1.5-3L slow cooker will feed one or two people; a machine that’s 3-5L will serve three or four people; and anything between 5-5.5L will feed four to five people; while a 6.5L machine will feed six to eight people.  Make sure your slow cooker is easy to set up and to clean. Many slow cookers burn around the bottom of the ceramic pot, so check that’s not an issue. Remember that some are much faster at cooking food than others and think about whether you want it to do extra things like roast a joint of meat, in which case an oval-shaped machine is generally better, especially for chickens. This produced the most succulent stews and flavoursome joints of all the machines we tested – and there’s enough to feed five to six people too. We found all the features genuinely useful, including the removable inner pot that you can use to brown your meat and soften your veg on any hob type before slow cooking, plus two cooking temperatures (high and low) and a digital countdown timer. And because it automatically switches to keep-warm mode once ready, you never have to put up with luke-warm food on your plate. Every area of this cooker is a doddle to clean (although sadly not dishwasher-safe) and the bowl can be used to store food in the fridge and freezer. It comes with some great recipes too. We love this quirky slow cooker, which has a matt powder coating, allowing you to write on it. So whether it’s “Hands off until dinner time!” or “Veronica’s venison stew”, have the chalk at the ready for your feisty or frivolous messages. The 3.5L capacity caters for up to four people and there are three heat settings, including keep-warm – handy if anyone is running late. But frustratingly, removing the “Write on Me” branded sticker makes a sticky, gooey mess – nail polish remover was the only thing that would get rid of ours.  If you’re feeding the masses or you like cooking up large quantities to freeze in batches, this is an excellent buy. Catering for five to six people, the inner pot can be used to get your ingredients off to a head start on the hob (except induction) before slow cooking, and the large oval shape means you can easily cook a whole chicken in it. Nifty features include the ability to programme the cooking time for up to 10 hours, the digital countdown timer and the three heat settings with indicator lights, with the keep-warm mode automatically kicking in for an hour when the food is cooked. You can’t bung the parts in the dishwasher, but it’s easy enough to clean by hand. However, the digital display could be clearer. This is our top recommendation for students, or anyone on a tight budget who is after something cheap and cheerful to use for batch cooking or for six to eight people. While other slow cookers at this price can dry out meat or pulses, this one keeps food rich and moist on all three heat settings, and was quick to cook on the high setting – although we would recommend the low setting for the best results if you can spare the time. We cooked a delicious chilli con carne and the oval shape meant it did a decent job of roasting a chicken. But it’s not as robust or non-stick as some and there’s no keep-warm function. For one or two people, this makes sumptuous stews, with rich, smooth sauces, both on the low and high settings. It’s easy to use and clean, with both the crock and lid going in the dishwasher, and because it’s small and light it’s no problem to store away afterwards. It comes with two heat settings and an auto-warm function to keep food piping hot right up until it’s served, although it’s a shame that you can’t use the inner bowl on the stove first. If you need to cater for a large family, there are bigger ones available in the same range. Another large 6.5L machine that will serve up enough for six to eight people, this one lets you sear the meat in the same pot before slow cooking (not induction though) and it couldn’t be simpler to use. Serving up hearty, evenly-cooked meals (we cooked a great curry), it’s also easy to clean afterwards, with dishwasher-safe parts. We didn’t rate it for roasts, though, and there is no keep-warm function. Also be aware it’s quicker than it claims to be, particularly on the highest setting, so stick to the lower two if you can. This is slower than most, but that can be a good thing if you’re out at work all day and don’t want your food to dry out before you get home. The auto-cook setting that adjusts the temperature for you while cooking (in addition to the usual high and low settings) is also great for producing succulent results. It makes a tasty roast, with its oval shape proving useful, although there’s no automatic switch-off and the parts aren’t dishwasher safe. Serving three people, or four if they have small appetites, it is available in both red and black. If you want a bigger machine, it also comes in 6.5L and 8L machines, as well as a smaller 1.5L capacity. Available in black or silver (we think the black looks more stylish), this feels well-made and has three settings of low, warm and high, all of which produce tender and tasty stews, curries, sauces and roasts, with dishwasher-safe parts for easy cleaning afterwards. It comes with some good recipes (including coq au vin and beef stroganoff), but it’s not for those that want upmarket features as it’s a no-frills machine whose efforts are focused on the basics. Wrong size? There are smaller and larger sizes available too.  Our favourite for larger households is the  . Not only is every feature handy, but it’s a joy to use from start to finish. For a medium-sized machine, the   will be a welcome addition to any home, while those who live on their own or with one other person will love the  .

" We found the carriers that will help transform the taste of your H2O Whether you’re trying to encourage the whole family to up their water intake or are concerned about the impurities in your area, a water filter jug can be an inexpensive solution. If used in kettles, filtered water will help to protect from limescale and aside from that, it’s also much better for the environment than using disposable plastic bottles.  The food and drink team at   put a selection of pitchers to the test, looking for clarity, purity and taste from each model. We also took into account how quickly and easily the jugs were to put together and how often you’ll need to replace filters. If you live in a hard water area, you may find that filters need changing more frequently than those that don’t. In other areas your water may contain a high level of sediment or other impurities. Some of the machines we tested were able to give you very accurate readings and advise on this accordingly. Not all filters work in the same, with everything from charcoal to magnesium being used to cleanse your water.  It’s also worth considering where you’ll keep your jug – do you want it to stay cold in the side of the fridge? Or is it more important to look beautiful on your dining table – we’ve covered both preferences. One thing is for sure though: once you’ve tasted filtered water, you’ll never be able to go back to plain old tap water again.  The Style jug is the latest model from the Brita family, and one that lives up to its name with a curvy body that fits neatly into the side of the fridge and a soft, shaped lid with silicon opening strap (available in either grey, green or blue). There’s an LED light that flashes green when you pour, yellow when the filter is starting to run out and red when it’s time to change. This jug uses the new Maxtra+ filter (if you currently have a Brita jug, your old filters won’t work in this model). The mesh is 25 per cent finer than before, resulting in an even purer taste than we’ve come to expect from Brita. Holds up to 1.3L of filtered water and 2.3L in total. Replacement filters are around £16 for a pack of three. ZeroWater has a five-stage filtration system that promises to remove virtually all solids from your tap water. Easy to put together, the bright blue, 2.8L jug did produce very clean, pure-tasting water and comes with a digital meter for you to test for levels of TDS (total dissolved solids). Downsides were that the 12 cup size didn’t fit in the side of the fridge, so this would be a better option for those that prefer their water at room temperature. As well as being able to pour from the spout as normal, there’s also the option of pressing a button to dispense water through the arm which we can see being helpful for young ones, unable to lift the jug. Filter life will depend on the level of impurities in your area but if moderate, you should expect it to tackle around 180 litres. Filters thereafter will cost £19.99.   The most beautiful jug we tested, its glass is hand-blown into a curvy shape and stopped with a branded cork, holding 1.1 litres. Instead of a plastic filtration system, there’s a piece of Binchotan charcoal, which will balance the PH of tap water. Simply heat it in a pan of boiling water for 10 minutes, pop in the jug of water and wait for it to work its magic. Water will be suitable for drinking after just one hour but will be best after eight. This should last for three months before you should repeat the boiling process and then after six months you’ll need a new piece of charcoal, which will set you back £20.95 for three pieces. If that all sounds bonkers, rest assured it’s a tried and tested method that the Japanese have been using for years.  This good-value jug will fit in the side of most refrigerators but still holds an impressive 2.8 litres. It uses a five-step filtration process to remove chlorine, limescale, herbicides, pesticides, lead and heavy metal and we were very impressed with the pure-tasting water. Simply slide the grid back on the lid and fill from your tap – just remember to make a note of the date when you change your filter as this jug won’t remind you. It was super-easy to assemble and fill up and each pack comes with three filters which should last you six months. A replacement four-pack of filters is currently available for £14.99. This stylish pitcher certainly looks the part, making a great addition to any table. Proving there’s more to this model than looks, the clever activated carbon filter has a slight electro-positive charge, making it attractive to chemicals and impurities. As water passes over the positively charged carbon surface, the filter will remove chlorine from your tap water, resulting in a fresh, clean taste. Expect to replace it after about two months (or 100 litres of water). Unlike the popular Bobble bottles where the water goes in first and gets filtered on the way out, here the filter goes in first, and you’ll need to wait for the water to drip through as you fill it. The plastic jug is BPA-free and fitted neatly in our fridge door. Holds 2L. Available in a selection of vibrant colours to brighten up your fridge, this jug can hold 2.6 litres of water – enough for a thirsty family. It uses mineral magnesium in the filter cartridge, which helps reduce the hardness of the water and we found gave a noticeably fresh taste. The spout poured water freely without any drips and there’s an electronic indicator to remind you to replace your cartridge (you’ll get three in the pack to start you off).  If you’re looking for a basic jug, Amazon’s own-brand version gets our vote. Filter cartridges are good value, coming in at just £10 for three, but they also take Brita’s Maxtra filter if you happen to have some of those to use up. The lid flips open and is easy to fill, and there’s a simple electronic indicator which will tell you when 30 days has passed. It has a 2.3L capacity. We all know someone that doesn’t like the “taste” of water, so while this model isn’t technically a filtration jug, we had to include it. Featuring a clever inner chamber, you simply slice up any combination of fruits, veggies or even herbs to create naturally flavoured water. We liked a mix of mint and lime or strawberry and basil. The outer is made of glass with a rubberised middle to stop it from slipping out of wet hands, while the inner chamber is made of BPA-free plastic. Choose from either coral, mint or grey – all of which are dishwasher-safe. It has a 1L capacity. The beautifully designed   glass carafe is sure to be a talking point on your dinner table. However for an everyday jug that fits neatly into your fridge with water that tastes great, the   gets our vote. Easy to put together, we appreciate the helpful electronic light to remind us to change the filter. If you have a little more room, the   produced the tastiest water.

" We find the machines that will leave you with evenly browned bread in the morning Sometimes, just a couple of slices are enough. And the two-slice toasters featured here are compact, take up minimal room on your kitchen counter, and evenly brown your bread. Choose a basic model if you only want to toast sliced bread, or if muffins, bagels and crumpets are a morning favourite, look for one with wider slots or a toasting rack. If toasties are your weakness, consider a model with optional cages that can be lowered in (or invest in a separate  ). Other features to consider are a defrost button, which will lengthen the toasting cycle to ensure bread has time to get nicely crunchy, a reheat button if you’re prone to forgetting you’ve put some bread in the machine, and extra-long slots are useful for bulky bread. You can find out more about what to look for with our  .  You'll find cheaper toasters will have a hard plastic casing, while more expensive models will have a harder-wearing exterior, such as stainless steel or enamel. Toasters range in price but we’ve found ones that do a great job from just £20.  If you happen to use gluten-free bread, you’ll know that it can take more than one cycle to get it golden enough. But American brand Crux has sorted the problem of toasting denser bread – just press the “gluten free” button for an extra-long programme that will brown it to perfection. We also like the wider slots, as they’re ideal for bagels and even a hot cross bun or two. The classy stainless steel with rose gold detailing gets our vote, too. For a little bit of glamour with your breakfast, how about this model that comes in stylish rose gold and platinum colourways? The matt finish makes this toaster look more expensive than it is and there are a whole host of functions making it easy to use. We like the extra-high lift, which means it’s simple to grapple hot muffins of a morning. A useful defrost button means you can toast straight from the freezer, and it leaves bread evenly brown on both sides.     The Sage range has done consistently well in IndyBest tests and this model is no exception. It has all the same buttons we love on its four-slice counterpart, such as “a bit more”, which is great for those who want extra browning but are prone to forget to cancel till the smoke alarm sounds. And the countdown illuminations are ideal for keeping an eye on slices, too. Other features include a crumpet setting, for stronger toasting on one side, and the “lift and look” button, which briefly raises the bread for a check on progress.   Fearne Cotton is a presenter, panellist, DJ, author and now designer of kitchen appliances, which you may not have expected, but she is a fervent foodie and has written a number of cookbooks. This toaster comes in lovely pastel colours, including our favourite blue shade, and has a whole range of matching kitchen kit. We particularly like the cool-touch sides and reheat button for cold toast rejuvenation, while our bread was evenly brown and crisp on both sides. The very latest in the Dualit range, this pop-up model toasts all types of bread right up to the edges, thanks to its side-by-side slots. It will also toast bagels on one side and warm on the other. But one of the best things about it is the “peek and pop” function, which allows you to lift bread out with the lever for a quick check without cancelling the toasting function. As ever with Dualit, it’s lovely quality with a steel casing and illuminated soft-touch controls. If style is your thing and you like to keep your kitchen counter looking on-trend, then Smeg’s range of toasters are worth considering. The smallest in the range, this retro two-slot model comes in a range of signature colours and has a dial control as well as a handy defrost setting. Toast will be evenly cooked, and there are six browning functions to choose from for perfection on a plate.   A classic model, there are not many high-tech gimmicks with this toaster, but it’s a good-quality, dependable choice. Cancel, defrost and reheat buttons give you everything you need to tailor your toast and the high-lift lever means no more burnt fingertips. A matching kettle is available, too.   Look like the back end of a bus first thing in the morning? Well, turn that frown upside down with the front end of this one! More than just a novelty, this officially-licensed VW Camper Toaster browns evenly, although at 240V, it’s the least powerful model in our round-up, so you’ll need to wait a bit longer for your breakfast.   Here’s something different – why pop toast up when you can pull it out instead? The beauty of this slimline model is that the tray is completely detachable from the toasting “tunnel”, which means you can empty out dropped crumbs after every use. What’s more, the clamp that keeps everything in place is fully adjustable so everything from the fattest focaccia to the puniest pancake is held tight. To use: pull the toaster insert out, push a button to open the clamp and pop your toast in, then slide back in and select your temperature. When you hear the beep, there’s toast waiting at the end of the tunnel.    For under twenty quid, you can’t go wrong with an AmazonBasics toaster. It’s not the most exciting thing to look at but fans of the functional, industrial look (yes, you with the bare lightbulbs over the breakfast bar) will love it. At 850W, it won’t take long to toast and there’s a nifty pull-out rack for warming rolls and croissants, too. It performed well, with crisp slices toasted right up to the edges, while the slide-out tray on the bottom makes crumb-cleaning a cinch.   This compact toaster has a cute wedge shape and the brushed steel with red accents gives it a sophisticated look considering the price. You’ll appreciate the efficient reheat button if you dash around in the morning and don’t always get to your toast at first pop-up. And there’s a button for frozen bread too – plus variable browning that means you can toast your slice to the level you like. Coming in three colours, there’s also a matching kettle available.    The   is cheap but not at all nasty. However,   has taken the top spot this time because of its cool styling and range of functions. Check out the other matching appliances too, and make your kitchen the toast of the town.

" Perfect the grilled cheese toastie – and much more – with a handy kitchen addition Grilled cheese, cheese toastie, toasted sarnie – whatever you call them, we’ve reviewed the best models on the market so you can create the perfect golden glow.  But there are some things you need to consider when choosing a machine: how many sandwiches do you want to be able to make in one go? How much space have you got to store the gadget? And, if space is an issue, perhaps you should consider a machine that does more than one thing – more on that below. So aside from the machine, what makes the perfect toastie? Well, who better to ask than Patrick Dwyer from  , a London-based food stall famed for its Haggis toasties.  “The perfect sandwich needs to contain a balanced combination of flavours,” he explains to  . “At Deeney's our toasties nearly always contain a sweet element like a chutney or caramelised onions, which work really well with melted cheese. At the same time we add a spicy, sharp ingredient like mustard to cut through the sweetness and complement the meat. “You want the ingredients to be evenly distributed, so you get each of the flavours coming through in each bite,” he adds. “The bread needs to be fresh, but strong and able to absorb all those flavours.” Good advice, indeed. We’d like to add that although it’s tempting, try not to overfill the sandwich, otherwise you run the risk of your fillings falling out, and no one wants that. If you’re using it as a single ingredient, you shouldn’t need more then 60g of cheese, and less if combining with others. Perhaps most important of all (although we never manage to heed this advice ourselves), do try and give it a couple of minutes out of the machine if you want to prevent third degree burns to your tongue.  The team at   put these machines under rigorous testing, trying out all manner of combinations – our all-time favourite being cheese and beans. While we leave you mulling over which is your favourite filling, read on to find out which came out on top. This stylish machine comes with two interchangeable plates, enabling you to use it as a sandwich toaster as well as a grill. Easy to clean, both plates can either be hand-washed or put through the dishwasher, and there’s a plastic cleaning device which helps protect the non-stick coating. There’s a choice of three heat settings for greater cooking control. There’s space to make two sandwiches at once with all the fillings staying put, and the only downside is the large handle, which makes it quite bulky and slightly harder to store. The recipe booklet has interesting suggestions that go beyond the standard cheese and ham combo, to really help you get the most out of the machine. We created broad bean and prosciutto frittatas, along with chocolate and mixed berry turnovers. Breville may have invented the original sandwich toaster over 40 years ago, but is it still the big cheese? (Sorry!) Well, the removable non-stick plates felt good quality, with a pleasing weight to them compared to some of the cheaper machines. There’s space to make two sandwiches, and the removable deep plates were easy to clean and allowed for maximum filling. The clever “cut and seal” system shapes the bread to fit the deep fill plates and cuts the sandwiches in to two separate triangles, ensuring ingredients stay put. Sandwiches came out with a perfect, all-over golden hue. It comes with a few recipe suggestions to try, including pizza pockets and cake bites, and we appreciated the black and chrome design. Get more bang for your buck with this multi-purpose machine from Russell Hobbs. As well as the timeless triangles, this machine comes with an interchangeable waffle plate and a grill (perfect for paninis). Very easy to remove, plates can be popped in the dishwasher, making cleaning up super quick. It takes a few minutes to warm up – just wait for the green light to appear and you’re ready to roll. The machine struggled to close with our thick white sliced bread inside, so it’s best to use medium-thickness bread if you want to make use of the handle locking clip which will keep the two slices of bread firmly together. Although it’s big enough to make two sandwiches at once, the machine has cord storage making it compact and easy to store away. Ideal for families, this toaster was the largest we tested, with enough room to prepare four sandwiches at a time. Having said that, the plates felt smaller and shallower than other models, so it’s best to buy smaller loafs for a perfect fit or be prepared to cut the bread to size. The machine heated up quickly but we found the handle a little fiddly. Plates are not removable so cleaning the machine is slightly more difficult, but the non-stick coating did the job and sandwiches came out without sticking, if a little on the small side. The cord storage helps make the machine more compact. Each of these machines from Tefal comes with both a toasted triangle sandwich plate and a waffle grill plate as standard, which can be easily swapped over depending on what’s on the menu. But if you get bored with those two, there are a whopping 16 grill plates to collect, including ones for bagels, biscuits and even doughnuts. The extra plates can be bought separately, and come in a box-set case, which makes storing them easy as you grow your collection. The plates had an effective non-stick coating and our sandwiches came out well but were quite shallow so be careful not to overfill. Unlike some of the other models, this had an on/off switch which is handy if you want to leave the machine plugged in to the mains.  This is a good value, useful addition if you already own a Dualit toaster and you’d rather not add another bulky piece of kit to your kitchen. The Dualit sandwich cage allows you to create lightly toasted sandwiches – but don’t expect the same oozy, melty toastie you’ll get from the classic machines. Working best with medium to thinly sliced bread, be careful not to overfill if you don’t want to spend the rest of your afternoon fishing the remnants out from the crumb tray. Well made, the handles remained cool enough to handle throughout the cooking time. The cages don’t go in the dishwasher though so be prepared to wash by hand.  If you’re heading off to uni this year, you might want to pop one of these solo sandwich makers in your case. Small but effective, this ultra-compact machine from Judge heats up quickly and has space for just one toastie at a time. Despite its diminutive frame, it created an even golden colour and sealed the ingredients in place. Even better, once it’s cooled down, it can be stored upright – taking up even less space in your kitchen.  This robust machine comes with extra deep plates, allowing for maximum sandwich filling. Once you’ve finished cramming them full with your latest flavour combo, they can be easily removed and put in the dishwasher. There’s a choice of three temperatures to give you full cooking control. It delivered great results with our thick sliced bread, and can also make omelettes and pastries too.    Another good option for those that like their sandwiches supersized, the Salter machine can handle thick, large slices of bread with plenty of filling, which is particularly useful if you   and don’t want to use standard supermarket-sized loafs. The large non-stick plates worked efficiently at sealing the bread and the “power” and “ready” lights make it easy to end up with a beautifully toasted sandwich, with plenty of filling, toasted crusts ‘n’ all.  Originally designed to keep steak and bacon flat for a faster cooking time, we found this device equally as useful when it comes to grilling sandwiches. If you already have a griddle pan, simply heat it up while you prepare your sandwich, taking care to butter the outside of the bread, just as you would with the machines, and then press down with this sturdy weight. It should only need two to three minutes on each side, but don’t forget to flip it (try using a spatula) for an even melt. If you’re looking for a straight up sandwich toaster, the   can’t be beaten for its even, golden toast, its iconic look and great price. However, we can’t resist some of the newer models that produce more than just a sarnie. We found the   the most seamless machine to use and the recipe booklet left us feeling inspired.

" Upright or canister? Bagged or bagless? We help you find the right machine to clean your home If you don’t know where to start when it comes to buying a vacuum cleaner, we’ve made life a little easier by explaining everything from the difference between bagged and bagless models to exactly what a robot vacuum cleaner is. We’ve also reviewed a whole heap of vacs ourselves to help you find out which ones are really worth buying and are the best fit for your home.   These are the most popular models. They’re best suited to deep cleans as they’re the most powerful style of vacuum – the attached rotating brush scoops up dirt from carpet and is usually especially good at picking up pet hair. Although they come in bagged, bagless, corded and cordless versions, upright vacuums are not as versatile as canister models due to their bigger build – their bulkiness means they aren’t great for getting in tight spots. But if you have a large house with big open areas or an open plan flat, this is the model for you.  Consisting of a main tank and a wand attached via a hose, these vacuums are lighter than upright models. They’re suitable for cleaning things like carpets, curtains, sofas and stairs and are the most versatile model, easily getting into tight spots and high corners. The main tank does follow you round as you clean though which can be annoying if it keeps bumping into tables and chairs. This type may also need more storage space as the wand and hose take up more room. The large tank may mean it’s less energy efficient too.  Stick vacuums are useful if you’ve spilt something in the kitchen and want to clean it quickly. They’re lightweight, streamlined and often have a removable handheld vacuum for smaller spots. Although they’re good in a hurry, the power doesn’t match up to an upright or canister model and cordless versions don’t tend to hold much battery. They’re most suited to small flats that are mainly carpet-free.  Designed to grab-and-go, these models are compact and only used for quickly cleaning small spots or crumbs left on the sofa. They’re also useful when cleaning the inside of your car. By design, they won’t replace your normal vacuum but are certainly a handy accessory to add to your cleaning cupboard. Don’t ditch your dustpan and brush though, as they don’t usually pick up all fine debris. Bagless versions may also need cleaning more regularly, to make sure all the dust and dirt is disposed of and not left clogging up the machine. Once you’ve picked what type of vacuum cleaner is best for you, it’s worth considering if you want a bagged or bagless version. This means as you vacuum dust and dirt it will either get sucked into a bag, which you can then remove and dispose of, or it will fill a container which you have to remove and empty the debris from yourself. With this in mind, it’s largely down to what you’d prefer doing, as both processes are usually easy to complete.  But those with allergies or asthma may be better off opting for a bagged version. This way you’re not exposed to the dust you’ve already got rid of again and it’s a more hygienic method. The downside to bagged versions though is the on-going cost of replacing bags as you dispose of them. Take a look at the   we've reviewed to make sure you get one you can rely on. Another decision to make before you buy is whether you want a cordless or corded vac. Cordless versions run on battery instead, so you’re maximum cleaning time will be limited to the battery life of the one you’re using (anything from 15 minutes to an hour). This can vary massively between models so always check this before you buy. Unsurprisingly, these models are easier to manoeuvre around the home without a cable getting caught on furniture, they’re also lighter too. However, corded versions on the whole tend to be better when it comes to cleaning, picking up more dust and grime from surfaces. We’ve tested   for ourselves though, to find out which ones will leave your home looking spick and span. The latest craze in cleaning is owning your very own robot vacuum cleaner. These small machines will work their way around your home mapping the layout as they go using in-built cameras and smart sensor technology. The beauty is they require minimal effort; select exactly where you want it to clean from a range of cleaning programmes and it will get going, returning to its base to recharge once it has run out of battery. But although they are a fun and hands-free way of getting the vacuuming done they aren’t as powerful as your standard vacuum cleaner, so you’ll still need one of them too. They’re also pretty pricey with models ranging from £100-800. With big brands like Dyson and Samsung launching their own versions, we tested   to find out exactly which ones are worth the splurge.  From September 2014, the European Union ruled that all new vacuum cleaners made or imported by manufacturers into the EU must have a visible energy rating label and less than 1600 watts of power. From September 2017, it will be reduced further to only 900 watts. This is all part of the EU’s drive to help tackle climate change.    The energy rating labels you now see on vacuums show, on a scale from A to G, how well they perform on hard floors, carpets, how much dust is re-emitted and their energy use. The label also tells you how noisy the vacuum cleaner is in decibels (dB) - if you want a quiet machine, go for the lowest dB figure.  While this label is a useful indication of performance, make sure you read reviews on your chosen model before you buy too. The performance suggested by manufacturers (which has been decided in a lab) doesn’t always match a vacuums performance in the real world.  Now you’ve worked out exactly what type of vacuum cleaner you need, take a look at our   to find one you can trust to get the cleaning done quickly.

" If your feline friend is purring away, it may not all be hunky-dory When a cat purrs, you might think it is as simple as a human smiling or a dog wagging its tail joyfully, but it’s more complicated than that. Cats don’t just purr when they’re happy but also when they’re distressed or afraid, according to pet nutritionists  . Evidence shows that purring is not only a method of communication. but a defence mechanism and way to keep calm in stressful or painful situations, such as when visiting the vet or giving birth. Because kittens are born blind and deaf, they need the vibrations from purring to communicate with their mother and littermates. The low frequency of a cat's purr causes a series of vibrations inside their body that can ease breathing, heal injuries and build muscle, while acting as a form of pain relief. Not only does it help sooth the cat, but it is though that there are health benefits for owners. Cat owners are at 40 per cent lower risk of a heart attack lower blood pressure after interacting with cats and hearing their soft purrs. Research has shown that cats’ muscles move the vocal cords and, as they breathe in and out, air hits the vibrating muscles, which creates the purring sound. You probably didn’t know that cats that purr can’t roar, and cats that roar can’t purr, because of the small bone found inside the vocal cords, which in roaring cats, is a flexible bone. This allows big cats to make a deep, roaring sound but in domestic cats is completely hardened and only allows air vibrations while exhaling and inhaling. Researchers have also recently identified a new purr called the ‘solicitation purr,’ which alters the normal purr into a more urgent ‘cry-like’ sound, which is similar to that of a crying baby, so that we instinctively want to help. Beyond just purrs there are thought to be about about  , including meows, hisses and shrieks to convey aggression.  Cats make more typical meow sounds by opening and closing their mouths, and those sounds can be friendly or demanding.  However, adult cats only meow to humans, not to each other, probably because their mothers stopped responding once they were weaned. “Cats vocalize so well to us because they’ve learned that we humans are really not all that on the ball in figuring out what the tail swish means, what the ear twitch means,” says Gary Weitzman, author of  . This knowledge of what cats are trying to tell us may be redundant in the near future as  .  The analysis using AI software of calls made by prairie dogs to describe colours and species of predators could lead to the concept being applied to household pets.

" Feed the whole family with a machine that leaves bread evenly browned Let’s make a toast to toast – the only thing tempting enough to get some of us out of bed in the morning. Whether you’re spelt bagel barmy or a sliced white loafer, we’ve found some toasters that will make your mornings golden. Toasting is a combination of drying and grilling, with each type of bread needing different timings. Brown and wholemeal items take longer, as well as fresher bread, which has a higher moisture content. Look for a toaster with a reheat button if you’ve got lots going on in the kitchen and don’t always grab it when it pops. A defrost option is handy too if you take bread straight from the freezer. All the models we looked at have removable crumb trays for easy cleaning and wider slots so you can dunk your doorstep with confidence. Here’s our pick of the best. 1.   £199.99, Lakeland A classic British brand, Dualit is known for its hard-wearing, hand-built machines with replaceable parts. This copper edition is a neat way to mix traditional and modern styling. The mechanical wind-up timer isn’t exactly space age technology, but it’s a design that’s been in use since the company manufactured its first toaster in 1952. The lever action means you can quickly check on toast as it’s heating too. There’s no fancy gimmicks either, just a matter of deciding on the length of time you want to toast for, between settings one and three. Slices were very evenly browned. It’s a top-quality toaster that’s worth the investment. 2.   £109.98, DeLonghi This larger model browned all types of bread evenly and quickly, while scoring highly with our tester for its stylish bands of colour-coded, glossy casing. The slots are wide enough to take chunky slices and there are defrost and warming functions. A few points lost as there’s only one dial for browning control, but if you’re looking for something that looks great on your worktop then the Avvolta should be on your shortlist. 3.   £22.99, Amazon There’s no messing around with this slimline toaster. Choose your setting, use the stop function button (if needed) and you’ll get pretty evenly toasted bread. That is, if your loaf is of the “small white toastie” variety – larger slices may need to go in sideways. You may not want fancy extras, but have a clever integral bread roll holder anyway. It rises above the slots to warm, rather than toast, bread rolls and croissants. A decent toaster at a bargain price.   4.   £69, Dualit An entry-level toaster, this version has a pop-up action rather than the brand’s traditional lever function. It has a more high-tech look too; the perforated sides and black casing look at home in a contemporary kitchen. There’s a defrost button for toasting bread straight from the freezer and a useful reheat option for busy mornings, which will warm the slices you’ve forgotten to grab without burning them.   5.   £29.99, Currys For a budget toaster, this has a lot going for it. For a start, it has a setting for toasting bread from frozen. The loading handles also have “lift and look” capacity for checking on progress or helping remove smaller items. Like the other models we’ve chosen, it has removable crumb trays for easy cleaning too. One missing feature though is separate settings for each two-slot side, but if you like all four rounds of toast the same colour then this is a bargain.   6.   £49.99, Home & Cook A slanted top makes for quite a different look on this efficient model, and there’s the choice of colours for the end panels – black, dark red, sage green and oatmeal grey.  At first glance, it looks like each of the four slots has its own control, but the centre two actually operate the high lift function. When using, the stop button glows red and with the dial controls browning. This one feels like a more traditional family choice.    7.   £85, Cuisinart This great-looking model will warm one side of your morning bagel and toast the other. The polished steel looks sleek and expensive, while it comes with a five year guarantee from Cusinart. We like the subtle blue lighting on the controls and the high-lift levers rise up more than other models we tested, making it a cinch to remove misshapen rolls and smaller slices of bread from the slots.    8.   £139.95, John Lewis If you’re short of space on the kitchen worktop then it’s worth considering a slimmer model that loads bread in two long slots rather than four short ones. This Smeg model is available in seven colours and has a stainless steel casing so feels sturdy and good quality. You can also buy a sandwich cage which will hold toasties firmly in place inside the toaster slots and a bun warmer which sits over the openings to gently heat pastries and croissants. The bagel toasting function completes this great all-rounder. All the functions worked exactly as expected and the toaster heated bread quickly and evenly. 9.    £47.99, Morphy Richards This is the most bling toaster we tested, and perhaps its shiny casing and triangular indents are not for traditionalists. If they do excite you, there’s a matching kettle, so fill your boots. This one has an energetic pop-up Morecombe and Wise would have approved of and bread is evenly toasted, though we did find a higher-than-average setting worked best for the results we wanted. A real countertop talking point.   10.  £153, ao.com We’ve featured this toaster in previous tests, but it’s still top of the list if you want more than just a pop-up. Toast a tad underdone? Usually you’d whack it on again only to remember it when you hear the smoke alarm or smell the carbon. This model’s “A Bit More” button is perfect for a quick boost and its “A Quick Look” control lets you check on progress without starting the cycle all over again. Bright LED sliders show your chosen “toastiness” then count down so you can co-ordinate your cuppa making. Clever stuff.   11.   £44.99, Swan You don’t have to blow your budget to find something in a colour to suit your kitchen. This classic-looking toaster comes in eight shades, from subtle cream to zesty orange, and there’s a whole range of matching kitchen appliances too. We liked the high-lift function and the fact the sides of this efficient model didn’t get too hot. A great mid-range buy which had simple controls and was easy to get the right shade of brown on our bread.     For a toaster that could still be in action long after you’re brown bread, the   is a quality heirloom piece with a timeless design.  A great all-rounder, the   useful tech functions make it worth consideration. But if you like your toasters like your toast – cheap, white and no-nonsense - then   is a bargain with your name on it.

" They promise to become a wardrobe essential this season, kicking the skinnies into yesteryear After years of slim-fit stiff jeans, men can breathe a sartorial sigh of relief because skinny trousers have finally died a death. Instead, this autumn is all about letting your legs roam free and giving your slacks a serious wide berth. A look that’s been steadily infiltrating the catwalk for a few seasons now, wide-leg trousers have definitively moved beyond skater and raver circles to enter the mainstream. The perfect antidote to the super-skinny tailoring etched by Hedi Slimane on men’s fashion for the last 15 years, when he departed from Louis Vuitton last year newly appointed Kim Jones set out to establish new proportions for the brand. As such, this season Louis Vuitton created a new, looser, wider-legged and drop-crotched trouser silhouette, inspired by the glory days of New York artists in the Seventies, Eighties and Nineties like Jean-Michel Basquiat and Andy Warhol.  Similarly, British designer Craig Green looked to uniformed fisherman to inspire his wide-brimmed bottoms, that saw an army of mariners decked out in tonal pants and drawstring sailor smocks with hoods.  For Marni though, new creative director Francesco Risso cited the bridge between childhood and adulthood as his inspiration. The vision came to life through thrift store-style suits that looked at least two sizes too big, slouchy camel trousers and check paperbag styles cinched at the waist.  While for designers when it comes to what constitutes a wide leg, it’s definitely the wider the better, real-life wear is another story. Stone Wide Leg Trousers, £24.99,  Instead of going for an ultra-wide, billowing pair, give yourself a little more room to breath so they can easily slot into your everyday wardrobe. The key really is to consider the silhouette you are creating, so make sure to balance out your bottom with an oversized, boxy jacket or shirt for a streetwear-inspired look.  We use cookies to enhance your visit to our site and to bring you advertisements that might interest you.

" Proof that skate shoes aren’t just for skaters anymore A pattern synonymous with rebellion and teenage angst, checkerboard garb has dominated runways of late but it hasn’t always been a fashion-world staple. Best known as the signature print of retro skate brand Vans, its humble beginnings started with unruly youths doodling on the sides of their shoes and, when the brand took notice in the late 1970s, the recurring checker print was born.  From  s stoner Jeff Spicoli to Jared Leto and Wiz Khalifa, over the years checkerboards have adorned the well-dressed feet of rock stars, sports stars and angsty adolescents alike to become a sartorial skate-culture signature.  But now, as menswear moves towards a more “don’t give a f***” aesthetic, its return to the fashion fold is nigh. For spring/summer 2017, Givenchy adopted the optical grid with a collection overcharged with busy prints. Here, warrior-like models stormed the runway wearing everything from crossbody pouches and leather bags to trainers, suit jackets and desert-ready harnesses swathed in the stuff. While some argued that the patterns skewed a little close to Louis Vuitton’s Damier check, Riccardo Tisci insisted that his take was inspired by games, more specifically the game of life. Proof that it’s a trend that’s here to stay, designers such as MSGM extended the look to their autumn/winter offerings too. Here, an otherwise youthful collection was combined with aristocratic style and gutsy athleticism that saw checkerboard patterns on everything from bombers and shearlings to geometric patches on puffers and vintage fur.  When it comes to real-life wear though, the line between conceding to the checker’s rebellious roots and veering into costume territory is a fine one. While the patterned sneakers remain a staple in most men’s wardrobes, these days you can get the print on pretty much anything – think socks, shirts, hoodies and even bags – all of which will channel a little bit of flare into your look.  Simply pair with a neutral palette of black, white and grey wardrobe basics so you don’t look too try hard.    We use cookies to enhance your visit to our site and to bring you advertisements that might interest you.

" This season the menswear shows were rife with subculture and served as a rejection of uniformity  London Fashion Week Men’s, with a newly designed logo by Tracey Emin, has celebrated its fifth birthday as well as its propensity to create an unrivalled space for homegrown and international talent.  Kicking off on the day of the UK election result, it was by no means a coincidence that some of the industry’s shrewdest young designers stuck to their signature anarchic style. At Liam Hodges – a brand that’s identified as a luxury label for the mad ones and the bad ones – the collection spoke to a generation that’s being broken down by “the s*** they have to deal with”. A screaming bear with a teeth-baring roar coupled with “noise” motifs echoed throughout as an update on Hodges’ signature graphic-slogan aesthetic. Likewise, numerous references from grime and pirate radio to ultimate car modding communicated his liking for DIY style. A continuation of his workwear-meets-sportswear signatures, a new Fila collab stole the show as he used a variety of archive pieces from the brand’s rich heritage: think instantly recognisable colour-blocking and classic panelled polo shirts. At Topman, the brand ditched its usual catwalk show for an intimate presentation that showcased less than half of the looks we have come to expect, but it paid off.  Titled ‘New Romantic’, the collection sought inspiration from a moment in time that changed fashion forever as it paid tribute to 1980s club culture with sharp tailoring, strong masculine V-shapes and boldly oversized outerwear. The clothes are a clear nod to the attitude of the era, but felt seriously contemporary. After all, the political upheaval of the 1980s feels rather familiar right now.   For his first standalone show, young designer Charles Jeffrey offered up a striking and surreal collection that opened with a performance by the Theo Adams Company, with dancers dressed in pink cardboard and paper mâché, leaves and petals. But the delirium didn’t stop there. This was, by his own admission, an “orgy” of styles that saw Tudor street urchins, tartan pinks and mantilla-clad duchesses unite into a collection that was all about creating a culture deviating from the norm.  But, what else would you expect from such a radical creative? Of course, there were a handful of wholly wearable pieces too, such as worn-out tailored jackets and T-shirts, embroidered denim and broad striped suiting.  Crashing back down to earth, design duo Cottweiler sought inspiration from summer days hanging out at caravan parks for their new collection.  Here, pieces were defined by the tension between the “synthetic interiors of a motorhome and the natural world beyond”, which seemingly offered up a luxurious take on functional silhouettes.  There were sporty protective layers, cargo trousers, backpacks and ponchos in shades of sand and sage, while the duo’s collaboration with Reebok continued with some ugly but oh-so-cool trail sneakers.   A designer that nails the balance between strong, urban influences and feminine details, Danish-born Astrid Andersen took the archetypical safari theme and completely turned it on its head. We saw a dusty colour palette of muted khaki, natural cotton and sand that adorned everything from keffiyeh-esque headwear to technical tracksuits.  But it was the unexpected addition of metallic lace muscle vests, velvet track pants and luxurious floral silk sports jackets that really stood out. All of this was complemented by a selection of jewellery from Danish brand Monies – think chunky wooden cuffs and oversized crystal rings. Over at Alex Mullins, the designer looked to capture the feeling of 1990s perfume adverts with a collection that gave timeless wardrobe staples a contemporary and almost surreal twist.  Referencing his previous collections, he photographed key pieces and digitally printed them onto silk, canvas and light cotton while using abstract shapes and acidic colours to set a summery tone. Although the metamorphic floral print shirting, droopy silhouettes and distorted silk face masks felt jarring, this was expertly tempered with muted coloured linen in mushroom and ubiquitous piles of denim.  We use cookies to enhance your visit to our site and to bring you advertisements that might interest you.

" Giving Santa, Frosty and Rudolph the elbow on your knitwear doesn’t make you a grinch Despite having a rather bad rep in the style stakes, Christmas jumpers have seen a revival in recent years to become a mainstream seasonal staple. So much so that if you were to scour any bar or pub in the coming week, chances are you’ll see packs of grown men sporting novelty knits not too dissimilar to the one Colin Firth sported in the 2001 film  .  But if style – and let’s be honest, dignity – matters to you at all, this kind of substandard festive-themed knit is a serious no-go. That’s not to say you should forego eye-catching knitwear altogether though, because luckily there are plenty of brands that tailor to men who want to look great and embrace the spirit of Christmas, albeit in a far more subtle fashion.  The key here, unsurprisingly, is to avoid anything with flashing lights, 3D embellishment and questionable delineations of snowmen. Instead, this time round you should be embracing cool patterns that are as subtle as they are desirable.  For the discernable gent, this means opting for Fair Isle prints, Nordic knits and super-comfy cashmere that will look just as good teamed with jeans as a pair of tailored trousers. An excellent alternative, bold stripes are indisputably stylish and still manage to retain that sense of cheer that effective Christmas jumpers so heavily rely on.  Otherwise, blocks of colour, geometric prints and unlikely animal designs like Coach’s famous dino Rexy are also a great option. Simply adhere to this advice and you should find that, as well as retaining your self-respect, you should also gain a festive jumper that won’t be immediately consigned to the back of your wardrobe come Boxing Day.              We use cookies to enhance your visit to our site and to bring you advertisements that might interest you.

" Stay cool, calm and collected when the heatwave hits with a much-needed device As this spring has revealed, you can never quite tell when an unexpected hot spell might come your way. So get prepared with one of our recommended fans. Don’t forget to think about how much space you’ll need for your fan to do its job, as well as the kind of look you want. Slimline tower fans, for example, are great for those short on floor space and who like a contemporary look, while traditional round blade fans can give a nice retro look, but they take up more room. Meanwhile, for those who want an uber-modern look – plus no blades or noise – check out our recommended Dyson fans, one of which doubles up as a heater in winter. Consider your room size too. A desk fan or mini tower fan are usually enough for a small room, while a pedestal, tower or floor fan are better suited to larger spaces. Remember not all fans are equally powerful, adjustable or variable in terms of speed settings, so these should be further considerations – and think about whether you want bonus features such as a remote control or timer. Seeing is believing with this quiet, blade-free fan that offers ultra-smooth air flow and 10 different fan speeds. In fact, we defy anyone who experiences it in action not to want one, particularly if they suffer from hay fever as it purifies pretty much all of the pollutants it detects in your home. Plus, it doubles up as an effective heater in winter, using thermostat control that can be set up to 37 degrees Celsius. Once the room hits the desired temperature, it maintains it and tops up if necessary. This is part of Swan’s range of stylish, retro-look home accessories, which come in a range of funky colours. There are two fans available: a pedestal one and this 12-inch desk one, which we found quiet and effective on all of its three speed settings, as well as easy to adjust so that you don’t blow all your papers away. If you’re after a sturdy and easily operational tall fan that’s sturdily built, but without an eye-watering price tag, this will serve you well summer after summer. It might not be the best looking of fans, but it’s by no means offensive and has a useful timer that can be set from 10 minutes to one hour. The height and angle of the fan are adjustable, too. This doesn’t take up much space, making it a great option to place on anything from a bedside table to a kitchen work surface. It’s easily transportable, quiet and has a handy four-hour timer, as well as a programme you can set to reduce fan speed slowly over time before it switches itself off completely – particularly handy if you like to fall asleep with your fan on. It’s not the most stylish of fans on our list, though. This slim, sleek and modern-looking black tower fan takes up very little room on the floor and creates a wide flow of air thanks to the automatic oscillation. There’s an easy-to-read LED display on the remote control too, meaning you don’t even have to get up from your armchair to work it, but it may be too noisy for some to have in the bedroom. There’s no need to assemble this great-looking fan – just get it straight out of the box and switch it on one of its three settings and use the tilting mechanism to suit your needs. It doesn’t make anywhere near as much of a racket as many other fans of this ilk, and it is robust too.  Available in a range of fun colours, these cheap and cheerful lightweight fans are handy for popping into your handbag to keep you cool on the go. So whether you’re suffering from a menopausal hot flush or getting a bit sweaty on your summer picnic, this will do the job nicely. Includes two AA batteries, which should see you through five or six hours of fanning. Most floor fans have a retro look, but if you want something more contemporary, our vote goes to this one, which also wowed us with its effectiveness and sheer power, while also remaining quieter than most. It’s much more robust than it looks too, and can automatically oscillate. You can buy portable air conditioners for less than this, but they don’t look as cool as this blade-free and extremely quiet fan, nor do they provide the kind of intelligent air purification that this does, apparently capturing 99.95 per cent of potentially harmful particles. You can even see the progress of your air-filtering on a smartphone app which, by the way, doubles up as a remote control. This may seem gimmicky, but it’s also good fun and does do its two jobs of keeping you cool and telling the time well enough for us to have been persuaded to include it here. Once you’ve connected it to your laptop with a USB cable, the fan (which you can adjust via the goose neck) starts to whir and the time lights up. It costs a bomb, but we love the  . Not only is the best looking fan in our round-up, but it acts as a great heater in winter too. For more wallet friendly options, our votes go to the   and the  .

" Friday saw the start of the 11th season of London Fashion Week Men’s – the biannual celebration of British menswear. Over the course of the weekend, the British Fashion Council showcased a parade of cutting-edge talent from both homegrown and international creativity. Here, we take a look at some of the highlights from the first two days of shows.   Only in its third season, What We Wear might be considered a relative newbie on the schedule but its latest collection proved it is fast becoming one of the most anticipated shows.  Created under the guise of chart-topping rapper Tinie Tempah, the brand has become known for its signature tracksuits, which took on a whole new form for autumn/winter 2018. Here, the south Londoner cited the capital’s public service workers and manual labourers as the influence behind the collection that offered a contemporary take on uniforms. Shapes were slimmer and more structured, as sportswear elements were combined with more formal aspects such as traditional suiting for added sleekness.  Similarly, the colours were more muted than we have come to expect – with shades like olive green, black and royal blue vivified by sporadic bursts of orange.  Knitwear also made an appearance in the collection for the first time, while trim cargo trousers and Breton shirts formed part of what could easily make up a hardworking day-to-day wardrobe.    A brand that’s identified as a luxury label or “the mad ones and the bad ones”, Liam Hodges saw a return to youthful pleasures this season, paying homage to 1990s raves, graffiti and grunge – courtesy of bygone classic kids’ show  , and Mr Blobby. Taking to a chequered runway, models sported a mixture of new-wave tailoring with slouched retro fits – and while Hodges’s signature graphics remained, new airbrushed prints of trippy flowers, leopard and smiley flowers were also integrated. While there was a definite grunge vibe overall with tartan trousers, zipped cuffs, an oversized suit covered in badges and acid green hairdos, the collection also showcased Hodges’s recent collaboration with Fila throughout, including the Disruptor II premium sneakerboot.   Presented in a 100 metre-long gallery inside Somerset House, this season’s Ben Sherman offering looked to its roots and the glories of Northern Soul with a capsule collection created in collaboration with Henry Holland – a designer recently nominated by the British Fashion Council’s Fashion Awards for Best Emerging Menswear Designer. Set to an upbeat soundtrack, a score of dancers took to the runway before models appeared in garb that perfectly fused Sherman’s classic silhouettes with Holland’s eclectic aesthetic. Featuring 29 looks with a 1970s twist, the unisex collection featured everything from short Harrington jackets to Mod-style suits, striped tracksuit bottoms and fishtail parkas.   A young designer renowned for her ability to construct strong looks with a focus on textiles and surface textures, Phoebe English created a refined capsule collection in deep navy, charcoal grey and flashes of bright red. Created in collaboration with knitwear designer Helen Lawrence, models wore textured waffle knits and rib employed in soft British lambswool yarn, as well as hats and scarves.  Grounded with a focus on form, English also presented detailed box and bomber jackets, smart wide-legged trousers with oversized turn-ups, and relaxed-fit joggers. Elsewhere, traditional menswear shapes were given a smarter edge with detailed shirts trimmed with scalloped sleeve overlays and long smock slips worn under full-length trench coats.    Established in 2005 by Topman and Fashion East, MAN has launched and supported a series of brands including JW Anderson, Christopher Shannon, Craig Green and Charles Jeffrey. This season, though, a new throng of pioneering creatives joined the line-up, including Rottingdean Bazaar, Stefan Cooke, and the “non-binary paradise” that is Art School. A brand informed by the founders and their friends’ non-binary gender identities, Art School’s second season at MAN – and their third with the support of Fashion East – saw a focus on redefining the limitations of gendered fashion. “Art School was created to convey a message, to create a dialogue of our lives and those of our friends, our loved ones who are never represented,” they said. Here, under the creative partnership of Eden Loweth and Tom Barratt, the collection focused on soft tailoring and what it means to “be soft”.  To that end, being soft in Art School terms was all about school girls’ skirts and slips, hand-sewn Swarovski crystals, transparent layers, duchesse satin and knitted metal yarn worn around the body “like floating chainmail”.

" Holidays are a time for rest and relaxation, but that’s not to say you should neglect your appearance altogether. Yes, we’re looking at you in the baggy board shorts and flip-flops. Instead, save yourself from looking questionably turned-out by planning what to pack for your sunny getaway in advance – we promise it’s more straightforward than it seems.  The last thing you want to do is stress about whether or not you’re wearing the right thing, so remember to keep it tight, light and stylish with a list of basic essentials guaranteed to keep you looking at sharp from the airport to the beach bar.  An absolute staple, the humble T-shirt should be the foundation of every man’s suitcase – but don’t overcomplicate things. Too often, Brits abroad can be tempted into opting for shouty graphics and dazzling colours, but there really is no need. Instead, keep it clean with a relaxed style and a round neck in shades like plain white, grey or navy. That said, you also can’t go wrong with a simple stripy tee.      What else would you pair with a casual T-shirt? Simple an easy to wear, a set of shorts in an understated colour will allow you to be more playful with the rest of your outfit choices. A word of warning here though: keep the hemline above the knee, and avoid anything with more than two side pockets.      A formal shirt is vital when you travel, as you never know where you might end up. For a failsafe option pick a classic cotton piece that’s finished with a full button placket and pointed collar. Alternatively, short sleeved shirts have suddenly become acceptable – providing you opt for a fifties-style bowling cut. Here, the Cuban collar and relaxed fit mean you have the freedom to  experiment with print without looking like a cruise ship entertainer.    While the temperatures might be soaring by day, evenings can often call for a little more coverage, so it might prove handy to pack a pair of trousers too.  Round off the bottom half of your wardrobe nicely with a muted pair in black, grey or khaki that are designed with a flawless finish, and unlined so you won’t overheat.    It’s likely that the pool will become your second home when on holiday so you really need to nail things in the swimwear department. Whatever you do, forgo the knee-length Bermuda shorts in favour of a cropped pair and, unlike your day-to-day shorts, don’t be afraid play around with colour.    This might sound obvious, but sunnies are an absolute essential when the sun comes out. If you want to play it safe, take your pick from Rayban’s selection of Clubmaster or Wayfarer styles. But, if you want to go for something a little different, Oliver Peoples guarantee to make you stand out from the crowd.    Trainers are a wardrobe staple for good reason and this doesn’t change when you’re on holiday. Sturdier than a pair of sandals, a pair of classic white tennis shoes not only look great but will give your feet the support they need while you’re off exploring.

" When attempting to execute the technique with any degree of success, it’s important to start with the basics Layering is a tricky art to master but get it right and you’ll be well equipped to tackle chaotic morning commutes and mid-afternoon blasts of cold air alike.  Aside from the obvious insulation though, layering comes with a multitude of other benefits from getting the most out of your clothes to showcasing your own take on style. But, where do you begin? When attempting to execute the technique with any degree of success, it’s important to start with the basics and that means working from the foundations of your outfit and building it garment by garment.  The first of which should be the thinnest layer, with a short or long-sleeved T-shirt being a good place to start. This can then be layered with a sweatshirt to help trap the warmth and an overshirt or shacket. For those unfamiliar with the term, the latter is a portmanteau of both shirt and jacket that strikes somewhere between the two and promises to quickly become the hardest-working item in your wardrobe.  Alternatively, hoodies also make for a nice middle layer as they are versatile enough to be worn on their own or with a jacket – while you could also consider swapping your T-shirt for a turtleneck.  Not only will this trade keep you warm but it also promises to add a level of sophistication to denim and slim suits – just make sure you invest in a nice fabric.  Another important element to consider when wearing multiple layers is that, while each piece may be exclusively stylish, they all need to work together to keep you looking sharp. As such, ensure your silhouette is proportionately balanced, keep textures and patterns to a minimum and opt for tonal or block-colour ensembles in earthy tones like grey, khaki, camel and navy blue.

" If Drake can wear it, why can’t you? While the notion of gendered stereotypes is waning thanks to Gen Z’s celebration of individuality, it seems we have a way to go until pink is considered a ‘safe’ shade for men. Traditionally fairly gender neutral, it wasn’t until the middle of the 20th century that domestic ideals fuelled a rise in pretty pink marketing, and thus an association with all things feminine and fluffy.  That being said, a change is in our midst with the menswear palette evolving in a seriously big way for 2017. Once again, designers have propelled the rosy hue into the fashion forefront as a younger generation celebrate the fluidity of gender.  At Gucci’s final menswear show, a collection inspired by travel saw creative director Alessandro Michele journey through the colourwheel with everything from green riding coats, red polonecks and even a yellow rainmac taking centre stage. But, in this density of colour pink stood its ground. Here the shade cropped up on tailored trousers, suit jackets and delicate rose embroidery. Closer to home, Topman Design served up a bevvy of sunburnt Brits with a lucid take on subcultures. From Mods and Teddy Boys to 1980s Casuals, classic sportswear pieces and conventional tailoring was given a subversive twist - think Pearly King emblems, towelling polo shirts and snaffle deck shoes to boot. But the fun didn’t stop there though, as models marched out decked in pink sweatshirts emblazoned by one of Britain’s greatest seaside destination – Margate – while others sported pastel pink suits and tracksuit co-ords. The trend was seen elsewhere too with J.W. Anderson’s floorlength tunics, Xander Zhou’s trailing hoodies and Haider Ackermann’s signature tailoring in bubblegum pink. Admittedly, it can be tough for men to get past the prejudicial walls of wearing this rosy hue but if standard-bearers of masculinity like Tyler the Creator, Drake and even Skepta are wearing it, then why shouldn’t you? Now, we’re not saying you should attempt to go all-pink-everything. Instead, if you’re looking for a way to incorporate it into your wardrobe, play it safe with one single item – whether it’s a simple tee worn under your tailoring, a pair of trainers or some socks.

" There may not be an arctic chill in the air just yet but autumn is in full swing and it’s as good a time as any to start searching for the ultimate winter coat.  When it comes to choosing “the one”, function often trumps style, but thanks to a recent runway fixation with off-duty cool, the new season’s must-have coat could mean we get the very best of both worlds.  The comeback of an old favourite, if you’re on the hunt for a super-comfy cover-up that will answer all your winter woes, then you’ll be glad to hear that the quilted jacket has returned to the fashion fold.  Finally, a coat you can reach for when the temperature dips below freezing that won’t completely rescind your style credentials. But, it hasn’t always been that way.  Invented in 1965 by Steve Guylas and his wife, Edna, the first quilted garment was a waterproof, quilted vest made for shooting which soon become popular among friends. Before you knew it, the original Husky jackets became a firm favourite among Sloane Rangers and even the Queen, who sported her corduroy collard number while riding. No longer the sole reserve of British country aristocracy though, the heritage-inspired style made a surprising appearance on the runway this season; from Craig Green’s uniformed fisherman that came arctic ready in quilted smocks, to Topman’s padded pink two-piece inspired by the pubbing and clubbing scene of the Nineties.  Elsewhere, MSGM sought inspiration from the world of athletics – and an unlikely paparazzi shot of the Queen “mean-mugging” in a Range Rover. The juxtaposition resulted in quilted gilet’s splashed with cobalt blue and a two-piece khaki suit made entirely from corduroy.  The perfect solution for those seeking comfort through the winter is to ditch the idea of a full quilted look and stick to outerwear, for a look that’s insulated for the coldest of weather while sharp enough to stand alone. Alternatively, if you’re not feeling too brave, details on sleeves or padded sweatshirts and bags are an effortless way to ease into the trend.  We use cookies to enhance your visit to our site and to bring you advertisements that might interest you.

" It’s the time of year when outerwear really comes into its own For those of us living in the UK, dressing to keep the frost at bay is about to become obligatory and topping the list for cold-weather clothing is a winter coat. The time of year when outerwear really comes into its own, a coat isn’t just an extra layer of insulation and your last line of defence against the increasingly parky weather.  But, as the first piece of clothing that others will notice it’s also an immediate statement about your new season style. Luckily, the choices available to you are almost limitless and for those with a little more sartorial savvy now is the ideal time to have your pick of styles. The overcoat is a classic favourite which can be worn with almost anything and always looks good when it comes to layering. Once super-formal, it can now also be paired with a casual hoody as well as a suit.  While investing in neutral colours would be the most sensible purchase, if you’re feeling more daring then we suggest trying autumnal tones or opting for a heritage check. Alternatively, plump for other classic menswear styles like the bomber or denim jacket which never seem to go out of style. For winter, most brands ensure you’re well equipped for fighting sub-zero temperatures with the addition of a fleecy lining or knitted sleeves.  This year also marks the return of an old favourite – the puffa jacket. A coat that you can reach for when the temperature dips without completely scrimping on style, it’s easily one of the most insulated jackets around and a great way to perfect your casual look.  Lastly, if you’re not one to shout out with bold patterns or colours then expressing yourself through texture is equally as effective. Here, we suggest investing in shearling which, while expensive, guarantees to last you a life time. If you’re a little strapped for cash though, head to the high street for affordable versions or swerve the cost with a coat that has just a shearling collar.  We use cookies to enhance your visit to our site and to bring you advertisements that might interest you.

" Astrological motifs and space-inspired references have dominated both on and off the runway this season, as designers and the style savvy looked to the skies for their next fashion fix. It’s official, stars are the new stripes. On the high street, fashion bloggers went wild for Marks and Spencer’s Constellation midi dress, which sold out almost instantly – and when it was restocked at the end of October, it sold rapidly at a rate of one every 90 seconds. Elsewhere, brands such as Reformation and Rixo London quickly became a firm favourite among the style set after plastering everything from cocktail dresses and skirts to swimwear in the pentagonal symbol. If that wasn’t enough, with Star Wars fever gripping the world you can probably guess the pattern used on the Monse dress that actress Daisy Ridley wore to the premier of the latest movie in the franchise,  . That’s right, strapless and sequined all-over, the epic frock came covered in galactic glittering stars. Of course, like most trends it may come as no coincidence that intergalactic motifs were first spotted on the runways of the Autumn Winter 2017 fashion shows. Chanel staged its show around a double C-branded spacecraft that even had a mock liftoff, as well as astronaut prints, sparkly lunar boots and metallic space blankets. Dior’s Maria Grazia Chiuri also explored constellations as an extension of her couture collection, with evening gowns emblazoned with phases of the moon, golden colours and cosmic elements scattered on sweaters.  A trend that proves entirely wearable in real life, if the thought of donning spacecraft-inspired garb is all a bit too Rebel Alliance for your liking, then there’s always jewellery.  Instead, star spangle your accessories with zodiac trinkets from Astley Clarke, twinkling jewels from Diane Kordas – or, if you’re on a budget, high street stores such as Topshop and Accessorize promise to light up your complexion.  We use cookies to enhance your visit to our site and to bring you advertisements that might interest you.

" This light Italian-inspired dish is perfect for cool summer dining  Dressing Salad First make the dressing by combining the marmalade with the vinegar in a medium sized bowl. Whisk to dissolve, add the water, chillies and then the oil and whisk again. Set aside. Alternatively place all the dressing ingredients into an empty and clean Duerr’s marmalade jar, screw on the lid and shake well. Fry the pancetta in a non-stick pan until nicely browned then remove and drain on a piece of kitchen paper. Steam the beans for a minute or two until just tender, then drain and cool in cold water. Place the salad leaves in a serving bowl and scatter over the pancetta, cooled beans, parsley and nuts. Season with pepper (but no salt as there’s enough in the bacon and cheese). Use a speed peeler to carefully shave the Pecorino over the top, then finish with a drizzle of the dressing.

" Tuesday marks the first day of Hanukkah, which means eight days of absolutely delicious, mouth-watering food.  For anyone who’s unfamiliar with the food traditionally served during this Jewish festival, you’re in for a treat… literally. Here’s everything you need to know about Hanukkah food. Chag Sameach! Hanukkah, otherwise known as Chanukah or the Festival of Lights,   of the Maccabees.  When the Jewish people reclaimed the Temple in Jerusalem, they only had enough oil to light the Temple’s Menorah for one day.  However, somehow the little oil they had miraculously kept the Menorah alight for eight days. Omg it's Chanukah tomorrow and I haven't planned when to have my first latke!  To commemorate this momentous occasion, Jews eat a lot of food at Hanukkah that’s been fried in oil. One of the most popular delicacies eaten during Hanukkah are latkes, which are fried potato pancakes.  Some Jews eat latkes sweet, accompanied by apple sauce, while others prefer them savoury, served with sour cream. You may not have heard of sufganiyot, but you’ll definitely recognise them. Sufganiyot are deep-fried doughnuts that are typically filled with strawberry jam.  In recent years, Israelis have become more experimental with their sufganiyot fillings.  on  You can now choose from an array of fillings, including chocolate cream, vanilla cream, caramel and cappuccino. Many bakeries also offer miniature sized sufganiyot, so you can tuck into a selection of different flavours. The literal translation for the Yiddish term “Hanukkah gelt” is “Hanukkah money.” Chocolate coins wrapped in silver or gold foil are given out at Hanukkah, much to the kids’ (and adults’) delight. : “The custom had its origin in the 17th-century practice of Polish Jewry to give money to their small children for distribution to their teachers.  on  “In time, as children demanded their due, money was also given to children to keep for themselves.” Bloch stated that according to 17th century Rabbi Magen Avraham, poor yeshiva students would often visit the homes of Jewish benefactors who would then give them Hanukkah money. “The rabbis approved of the custom of giving money on Chanukah because it publicised the story of the miracle of oil,” Bloch wrote. Beef brisket is served at many Jewish festivals, including Rosh Hashanah, Passover and Hanukkah. Brisket first became popular among Jews due to the price.  Many Jews living in eastern Europe struggled in poverty, which is why the low cost of brisket was particularly appealing. Chanukah is almost here, but it's not too late to order your feast. Choose from Chef Prepared classics like classic potato latkes and delectable beef brisket.    In Gil Marks’  he writes: “The often-impoverished Jews of eastern Europe could rarely afford to ‘live high on the cow’ - to buy the more tender cuts from the rib and chuck. “[So] they learned how to make do with the cheaper, less desirable parts.” Beef brisket has since become a tasty staple dish in many Jewish households.

" As the festive season is over, now it's all about being light and bright. But step away from the fad diets and instead go back to basics and create light and bright salads to awaken your taste buds It’s the rare soul who hand on heart can say that they didn’t over indulge during the Christmas holidays. Mince pies, goose fat roasted potatoes and the odd cheese board (or ten), and we’re all feeling a bit like Henry VIII in his later years. But if our eating is extreme during the hols, so is the January backlash. It’s all detox and fasting and odd diets and deprivation. It’s New Year’s resolutions that are broken before we finish saying them. January doesn’t need deprivation; January needs balance. Balance isn’t bad, in fact balance is very good. It’s not about calories but about reinvigorating our taste buds with fresh flavours, textures and bite. If Christmas is creamy luxury, then let January usher in some sour notes, bitter flavours and punch. It’s just what our jaded taste buds need to wake them up from a sluggish stupor. Citrus is a natural. We’re spoiled for choice now, so why not take advantage? Balance the sour with salad greens like radicchio for bitterness and sprinkle with pomegranate seeds for crunch. A hint of honey in the salad dressing mellows things out without removing the zing, while dill adds a welcome herbiness. Serves 4 as a side dish Dressing Slice a bit off the stem end of the grapefruit and repeat on the opposite end. Stand the grapefruit up on a chopping board on one of the cut ends. Take a sharp knife – a serrated one works well – and following the contour of the fruit, slice off the skin and white pith. Hold the fruit over a bowl so you capture all the juices. Take the knife and make ‘v’ shaped cuts to remove each individual segment. Place the segments in a separate bowl and repeat with the two blood oranges. Squeeze the remaining pith over the juice bowl to extract any remaining juice. Mix the citrus juices with an equal amount of oil and add in honey to taste. Season generously with salt and pepper and set aside. Cut the pomegranate open and remove the seeds. Depending on the size, you’ll want to use a quarter to a half of the total pomegranate. Remove all the pith from the seeds and set them aside. Gently wash the lettuces in cold water and spin in a salad spinner. Keep the leaves whole unless they are very large. Arrange the lettuces in a salad bowl or platter. Garnish with the citrus segments, sprigs of dill and pomegranate seeds. Drizzle with the dressing and serve at once.   We use cookies to enhance your visit to our site and to bring you advertisements that might interest you. Read our   and   Policies to find out more.

" If you might be in danger of serving up plain, boiled vegetables alongside your turkey, turn to Christmas king Jamie Oliver to help you transform your festive feast Whether it’s your first time cooking Christmas dinner, or you’re looking to step away from your age-old favourite recipes, you must never overlook the importance of the side dish.  Roast parsnips and carrots are essential, but other winter vegetables, including red cabbage and butternut squash, give variety and colour.  covers the essential recipes you need, from party nibbles to turkey leftovers and everything in-between, and reinvents the classics, from Christmas pudding to baked Alaska. These sexy, little beauties are super-fun to make, look amazing, loads of people will never have seen or enjoyed them before and the flavour combination here just cooks into the potatoes so, so well. People. Will. Talk. About. These. Total time: 1 hour 15 minutes Serves 10 as a side Preheat the oven to 180°C/350°F/gas 4. The fun and unique part of this side dish is that you need to slice multiple times through the potatoes, but – importantly – without going all the way through, giving you a kind of concertina-style potato. This looks beautiful but also makes them wonderfully absorbent of flavour and amplifies their crispiness. Try to choose small potatoes, give them a wash, and if you have any larger ones, cut them in half and use the flat side as a base. To make this process as simple as possible, place a potato on a board between the handles of two wooden spoons, so that when you slice down into the potato the spoons stop the blade from going all the way through. Carefully slice at just under ½cm intervals all the way along. Repeat with all the potatoes, placing them in a large roasting tray as you go. Pick half the thyme leaves and put into a pestle and mortar and pound with the turkey dripping or oil. Spoon the mix over the potatoes, making sure the fat gets down into the cuts you’ve made, then season with sea salt and black pepper. Roast for 1 hour, or until the potatoes are golden and tender. Meanwhile, tear the bread into a baking dish, add the hazelnuts and toast in the oven for 10 minutes. Remove and allow to cool, then tip into a food processor, strip in most of the remaining thyme leaves, add a pinch of sea salt and black pepper and half the cheese, and pulse into coarse crumbs. When the hour is up, sprinkle the crumbs over the potatoes, then finely crumble a little bit of the remaining blue cheese on to each one. Dress the rest of the thyme sprigs with a tiny bit of oil and sprinkle randomly on top. Return to the oven for a final 10 minutes, or until the cheese starts to melt, then serve. : You can cook these in advance up to the point where they’re roasted and sprinkled with the toppings, then just finish them off when you’re ready, ensuring that they’re hot and crisp before serving.

You get wonderful flavours exchanging in the centre, great textures and the slices look amazing. Total time: 2 hours 30 minutes Serves 6 as a main or 10-12 as a side Preheat the oven to 180°C/350°F/gas 4. Wash the squash, carefully cut it in half lengthways, then remove and reserve the seeds. Use a spoon to score and scoop some flesh out, making a gully for the stuffing all along the length of the squash. Finely chop the scooped-out flesh with the seeds and put into a frying pan on a medium heat with 2 tablespoons of oil. Peel, finely chop and add the onion and garlic, stirring regularly while you pick the sage leaves and finely chop them with the sun-dried tomatoes and chestnuts. Stir into the pan with the rice, cranberries and allspice, add a good pinch of sea salt and black pepper and a swig of red wine, and mix well. Fry for 10 minutes, or until softened, stirring occasionally. Pack the mixture tightly into the gully in the two squash halves, then press the halves firmly back together. Rub the skin of the squash with a little oil, salt and pepper, and if you’ve got them, pat on any extra herb leaves you have to hand. Place the squash in the centre of a double layer of tin foil, then tightly wrap it up. Bake for around 2 hours, or until soft and cooked through. Once ready, take the squash to the table and open up the foil in front of everyone, then carve into nice thick slices and serve with all the usual trimmings.

Total time: 35 minutes Serves 8 to 10 as a side Click away any tatty outer leaves from your cabbage, trim off the base, cut the cabbage into wedges, then finely slice it and put aside. Finely slice the bacon and place in a large casserole pan on a medium heat with 1 tablespoon of oil. Leave it to crisp up while you peel, core and dice the apples. When the bacon is crispy, strip the rosemary leaves into the pan, stir for 1 minute, then use a slotted spoon to remove the bacon and rosemary to a plate, leaving the smoky bacon fat behind. Add the fennel seeds and diced apples to the pan, then tear in the prunes, removing any stones. Stir and fry for 2 minutes, then finely grate in the clementine zest and squeeze in the juice. Add the vinegar, cabbage and a pinch of sea salt and black pepper. Cook with a lid ajar on a low heat for 20 to 25 minutes, or until cooked through and a pleasure to eat, stirring well every 5 minutes to help intensify and mix up the flavours. Serve sprinkled with the crispy bacon and rosemary leaves. : Make this the day before and simply reheat it in a pan – it’ll taste great, but if you do this I’d recommend stirring the bacon and rosemary through it rather than serving them on top as a garnish.

" A savoury pick-me-up with creamy sweet potato and tart tomatillo salsa, these rostis are the perfect comfort food for slow weekend mid-mornings People tend to either love or loath brunch, a meal mash up of breakfast and lunch. But if you’re lucky enough to have a lie-in on the weekend, brunch is a gift. You’ve missed breakfast but you can’t wait for lunch to eat. This is when brunch is just the ticket. My rules for brunch are that it needs to be substantial – something that can fuel me through till dinner. It also needs to be something that won’t take ages to clean up (it is the weekend after all). This recipe ticks both boxes. You can cook everything in one frying pan, minus charring the tomatillos, and, to be honest, you can skip that step if you want. The sweet potatoes cook first, getting a nice crispy layer underneath, then you add the eggs. The tomatillo salsa gives it a nice, tart edge that cuts through the creaminess of the sweet potato. Tomatillos are a member of the nightshade family and you can buy tinned ones online or fresh at some green grocers. Fresh is best and you simply peel away the outer papery skin. Tomatillos have a slightly sticky covering, which you rinse off before chopping. This is a riff on a classic salsa verde but I’ve used red chillies rather than green.   Serves 2 For the salsa To make the salsa, peel off the outside papery layer of the tomatillos. Char them under a grill or on a gas flame until they’re slightly blackened in places. Chop them and place in bowl. Add the juice of half a lime (you can add more if needed), the coriander, chilli pepper and spring onion. Taste – add more lime juice if you want – and season with salt. Set aside.  Peel the sweet potato and coarsely grate it. Heat a frying pan over medium-high heat. Add 1 tablespoon of the oil and spread the grated sweet potato over the bottom of the pan evenly. Sprinkle with some salt and drizzle the other tablespoon of oil over the top. Cook until the bottom of the sweet potato has browned and is nice and crispy. Crack the eggs on top. You can either cook the eggs on the stove or in the oven at around 180ºC if you’re using an ovenproof frying pan. Cook until the whites are set but the yolks are still runny. Divide and serve on two plates topped with the tomatillo salsa.  We use cookies to enhance your visit to our site and to bring you advertisements that might interest you.

" An easy one-pot dish that pairs seasonal superstars asparagus and new potatoes with easy sausage meatballs and juicy vine tomatoes Cook: 40 minutes Serves 4 Preheat the oven to 180C fan. Using a sharp knife, make a series of thin slices (about 2mm apart) all along the new potatoes, cutting down about three quarters of the way through so the potatoes stay intact at the base. Add to a large roasting tin and drizzle over the olive oil, sprinkle on the oregano and season with salt and pepper. Toss about to evenly coat. Roast for 10 minutes. Cut each sausage into four, peeling away and discarding the skins as you go. Remove the potatoes from the oven, scatter around the sausage pieces and slide back into the oven for another 15 minutes.  Remove the roasting tin from the oven once more, scatter over the tomatoes and the garlic and toss to coat, turning the potatoes so they are all cut side-up. Slide back into the oven and roast for another 10 minutes. Finally, add the asparagus to the tin, tossing to coat and roast for 5 more minutes. Remove from the oven and serve straight away.

" From the traditional to the indulgent and alternative, here are three cracking options to serve up this year Roast turkey is always absolutely delicious at Christmas. First steamed with aromatics, then roasted until the skin is crisp, this roast turkey recipe results in a bird that is beautifully tender, moist and full of flavour. As well as apricot stuffing, serve cranberry and bread sauce with the turkey, along with plenty of beautiful vegetables and roast potatoes with lots of gravy Cook: 4 hours 30 minutes, plus resting time Serves 6 Roast Bronze turkey 
½  Roast potatoes Buttered carrots Apricot stuffing Bread sauce 
½ Cranberry sauce Pigs in blankets Gravy Brussels sprouts If you prefer, you can make the cranberry sauce, bread sauce and stuffing in advance – these can also be frozen a couple of weeks ahead to save time on the day. For the cranberry sauce, place the orange juice and zest in a pan with the spices and simmer gently to reduce by half. Add the sugar and cranberries, bring to the boil and reduce to a simmer for 10 minutes so the fruit breaks down and stews. It may need another 5-10 minutes on this heat if it looks too thin​. Taste for sweetness, then allow to cool before chilling in the fridge. Alternatively, place in a lidded container and freeze, then place in the fridge to defrost the night before using. For the bread sauce, place the milk and the clove-studded onion into a pan with the bay leaf. Bring gently up to a simmer, then pass through a sieve onto the bread. Stir until the bread softens, then add the cream, nutmeg and seasoning. Leave to cool, then chill in the fridge. Alternatively, freeze in a lidded container, then place in the fridge to defrost the night before serving. To prepare the stuffing, add the apricots, brandy and a splash of water to the pan, then bring to the boil. Remove from the heat, leave to soak until softened, then drain off the liquid. Dice the apricots and place in a bowl​. Add all of the remaining stuffing ingredients to the bowl with the apricots, correct the seasoning and chill in the fridge. Alternatively, freeze as you did with the sauces and defrost thoroughly in the fridge the day before using​. To cook the turkey, preheat the oven to 210C/gas mark 7. About 20 minutes before cooking, bring the stuffing out of the fridge to come up to room temperature. Season the turkey well inside and out. Fill the cavity with the prepared stuffing and place the stuffed turkey into a roasting tray. Spread the softened butter over the entire bird and cover with pancetta​. Arrange the onions, leeks, carrots, celery, garlic, thyme and bay around the turkey. Pour 1 litre of water into the roasting tray. Wrap the entire tray with foil, making sure the foil is tightly covering the turkey and roasting tray – this will allow the turkey to gently steam in the oven. Place in the oven and cook for 45 minutes, then reduce the temperature to 170C/gas mark 3 and continue cooking for a further 2 hours. For the last 30 minutes of cooking time, remove the foil from the turkey and peel off the bacon. Increase the temperature to 200C/gas mark 6 and roast until the skin of the turkey is golden brown and crisp. To prepare the potatoes, peel and cut into quarters. Place them into a bowl under running water for 5 minutes to remove excess starch. Cover the potatoes with fresh water in a large saucepan and bring to the boil​. Cook until the potatoes are almost breaking apart, then drain carefully and leave to steam and cool. Pour oil into a roasting tray and place in the oven to heat up. Once the turkey has roasted, remove from the oven (reduce the oven temperature to 180C/gas mark 4) and allow to rest for 45 minutes – this will ensure the bird retains its juices and stays moist. Add the potatoes to the roasting tray in a single layer and place in the oven until golden brown and crisp, turning every 20 minutes. Meanwhile, in a pan large enough to hold the carrots in a single layer, melt the butter. Add carrots, thyme and bay and place a lid on the pan, then cook over a low heat until tender, making sure it stays at a gentle simmer and adding a splash of water if the butter gets a little hot. Do not allow the carrots to fry​. To prepare the pigs in blankets, wrap each sausage in a rasher of bacon, place on a baking tray and cook in the oven until golden brown. To prepare the gravy, pour all of the excess fat from the turkey roasting tray into a pan, then add the carrots, celery, onion and thyme and cook until caramelised. Add the red wine and reduce, then add the aromatics, chicken and veal stock and reduce by two-thirds​. Pass through a fine sieve into a clean pan and return to the stove. Bring to the boil, correct the seasoning and whisk 50g butter into the gravy​. Peel the outer leaves from the sprouts and criss-cross the bottom of each one. Blanch in boiling water for 3 minutes, then drain. Heat a generous knob of butter in a large pan and add the sprouts, stirring to caramelise lightly and coat in the butter. Season well and set aside until ready to serve. To serve, carve the turkey and serve with the stuffing, roast potatoes, buttered carrots, buttered sprouts, cranberry sauce, bread sauce and gravy.   With their delicious chicken, mushroom and broccoli filling, and crisp filo casing, these festive crackers make an excellent lighter choice for a dinner party among all the traditionally rich Christmas fare. Served with a salad or some extra veg, these are a great choice for feeding a crowd. Cook: 1 hour 20 minutes Serves 8 To serve 
½ Place a large saucepan over a medium heat and add the oil. Once hot, add the onions and stir until soft and golden​. Then stir in the chicken and cook until golden brown, approximately 5 minutes. Add the fresh and dried mushrooms and cook for a further 5 minutes. Add the broccoli and chicken stock and reduce until the pan is almost dry​. Stir in the crème fraîche and season to taste. Transfer to a bowl and allow to cool. Once cool, store in the fridge for 20 minutes until cold and set. Lay a sheet of filo pastry on a work surface. Brush half of the sheet with butter and fold over to create a double-layered square. Repeat with the remaining filo to make 8 double-layered squares. Divide the mix into 8 portions and shape each portion into a cylinder. Place a cylinder of the chicken mixture across the middle of a square of pastry towards the front edge. Fold the edge into the filling and roll to make a cylinder. Just before getting to the opposite edge, brush with melted butter to seal. Twist the ends of the pastry to make it look like a cracker – trim off some pastry if it looks too big. Brush the whole cracker lightly with melted butter and place on a non-stick baking tray. Repeat to make more crackers. Preheat the oven to 170°C/gas mark 4. Place the baking tray of crackers in the middle of the oven for 20 minutes, or until golden brown. Meanwhile, in a bowl, fold the paprika and chives into the crème fraîche. Once the crackers are cooked, remove and serve with a dollop of the crème fraiche on the side.   The “Yorkshire pot” is a legendary roast, traditionally containing five deboned birds in one enormous roasting joint. This five-bird roast recipe can be made at home, cutting the meat into strips and rolling in air-dried ham. Better still, it can be prepared the day before cooking. Five-bird roasts often contain only game birds, but James adds chicken to lighten the flavour. Cook: 1 hour 30 minutes, plus overnight resting, 2 hours 30 minutes poaching and 1 hour 30 minutes roasting Equipment Ensuring your boning knife is very sharp, bone the duck legs by cutting out and removing all of the bone and cartilage. Cut each of the duck breasts and chicken breasts into three lengthways, and slice the duck legs into strips. To prepare the stuffing, place the sausagemeat, cranberries, pistachios and juniper berries in a bowl and mix thoroughly with your hands​. Lay several layers of cling film, each about 60 x 30cm, out on a work surface. Lay the slices of ham onto the cling film to form a rectangular base (smaller than the cling film) to start building the roast. Lay the duck breast in a line down the centre of the ham, then lay about half the stuffing mix in a thin sausage either side of the length of the duck. Lay the chicken strips along one side of the stuffing, end-to-end to cover the exposed length of ham. Repeat with the grouse, pheasant and partridge breasts and duck leg until all of the meat (except the stuffing) is used up – the ingredients should all be laid out in even lines. Top with the remaining stuffing mix. To roll the roast, take one side of the cling film and roll and wrap the ham over to encase the meat and stuffing, forming a large sausage encased in the ham and cling film. Place in the fridge to rest overnight. To cook, preheat a water bath to 75C and, making sure the roast is completely sealed in cling film, cook for 2½ hours. After this time, remove from the cling film, place in a roasting tray and cook at 180C/gas mark 4 for 1-1½ hours. To check that it is cooked, slide in a sharp knife – the juices should run clear. If you don't have a water bath, remove the roast from the cling film and carefully wrap in foil. Roast in the oven at 160C/gas mark 3 for 2 hours, then remove the foil and roast for a further 1-1½ hours at 180C/gas mark 4 until the juices run clear. Remove from the oven and allow to rest for at least 20 minutes. Cut into thick slices and serve.

" From luxury treats for the adults to fun – and messy – projects for the kids, there’s something for everyone in Michael James's new book Here’s something for everyone to enjoy at Christmas. This gingerbread has enough warm spice to make a sophisticated treat for the grown-ups, but not enough to turn the kids off. The kids can get involved in making them, too; cutting out the shapes and icing them can be a lot of fun. The gingerbread will last up to five days in an airtight container, so it makes an excellent gift in the lead-up to Christmas. Makes 24 Gingerbread Icing To make the gingerbread, sift together the flour, spices, bicarbonate of soda and salt in a medium-sized bowl. In a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, cream the butter, sugar and golden syrup until pale but not too aerated. With the mixer still running, add the egg yolks one at a time, beating between each addition until just combined. Add the dry ingredients and mix gently on a low speed, until just combined. Divide the dough into two pieces and roll each piece out into a disc roughly 2cm (¾ in) thick. Wrap each disc in plastic wrap and refrigerate for one hour, to rest. Remove the dough from the fridge and roll each disc out between two sheets of baking paper into a sheet 5mm (¼ in) thick. Leave them between the sheets of baking paper and return them to the fridge for an hour, to set firm. Preheat the oven to 170°C (340°F). Remove the biscuit dough from the fridge and lay the sheets out on the bench. Line three trays with baking paper, and cut your shapes out of the dough with cookie cutters, laying them out evenly on the trays and leaving 2cm (¾ in) between each biscuit to ensure an even bake. Bake for six minutes, then turn the trays around and bake for another four to six minutes, until the biscuits are golden brown. Set aside to cool completely before icing. To make the icing, place the egg white in a medium sized bowl and add the icing sugar one spoonful at a time, whisking lightly to fully incorporate the sugar between each addition. Whisk through the lemon juice, then transfer the icing to a piping (icing) bag fitted with a fine nozzle and decorate your biscuits as you like. The gingerbread is ready to eat once the icing has set.   The dark red cherries and green pistachios set in snow-white nougat make this treat the very image of Christmas. It’s so pretty and festive looking cut into small pieces for your Christmas table, and it makes a beautiful gift simply wrapped in clear cellophane. The sour cherries are a nice counter to the sweetness of the nougat, and the pistachios add texture and nuttiness. Makes one 24cm (9½ in) square tin 6 rice paper sheets : Timing is very important with this recipe. You need to have the sugar at the correct temperature just as the egg whites come to a meringue, as well as having the chocolate already melted, and the pistachios and cherries warm. It’s important to have the nuts and cherries warm so they don’t solidify the nougat before you have time to mix them through properly at the end. Read through the method thoroughly before you start making the nougat – it will make the process smoother. Make the nougat the day before you need it, to allow it to set overnight. Lightly grease the sides and base of the tin, then lay the rice paper over the base, shiny side down, so that the sheets are slightly overlapping (cut to fit if needed). Preheat the oven to 170°C (340°F). In a large stockpot, mix together the sugar, glucose syrup, honey and water. Place over a high heat and bring it up to 140°C (280°F) on a sugar thermometer. This will take about 20 minutes. Meanwhile, half-fill a saucepan with water and bring to a simmer, then place a metal mixing bowl over it, ensuring that the bowl doesn’t touch the water. Put the white chocolate into the bowl and melt, stirring occasionally to remove any lumps. Be careful not to overheat the white chocolate. Turn off the heat and leave until ready to use. If it starts to set, gently reheat it using the same method.  Spread the pistachios out on a baking tray and bake in the oven for four minutes, until lightly toasted. Add the cherries to the tray and return it to the oven, then turn the oven off and leave the door slightly ajar. This will help keep the pistachios and cherries warm until you’re ready to use them. Place the egg whites in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment. Once the sugar syrup reaches 140°C (280°F), start whisking the egg whites on a medium-high speed until a soft, loose meringue starts to form. By this time your syrup should be at 145°C (290°F). Take it off the heat and, with the whisk still running, pour the syrup slowly into the egg whites in a thin, steady stream, being very careful not to get splattered by the molten sugar. The mixture will increase in volume and become very thick. Turn the mixer down to a low speed and leave it to mix and cool for a few more minutes. Remove the whisk attachment and add the paddle attachment to the mixer. Mixing on a slow speed, slowly add the melted white chocolate in a thin stream, until totally incorporated. Turn the mixer off, add the nuts and cherries, then turn it back onto a low speed. Mix just until the nuts and cherries are evenly distributed – be careful not to mix for any longer, or the cherries will bruise. Wearing gloves (this bit gets messy), use a scraper to scoop the nougat out of the bowl into your prepared tray. With wet hands, press the nougat into all the corners of the tin and flatten out the top. Place another layer of rice paper over the top, with the shiny side up, pressing gently to flatten it over the top for a nice even finish. Leave the nougat in a cool dry place to set overnight. Run a knife around the edge of the tin to loosen the nougat, then invert it over a chopping board, gently pressing the base to release the nougat (it might need a bit of a wiggle). Use a large cook’s knife to trim the edges and cut into your desired portions. The nougat will keep for several months at room temperature in an airtight container. Don’t store it in the fridge, or anywhere too warm.   Mince pies were one of the earliest written British recipes, first documented in the Middle Ages. They originally contained minced meat, offal and suet, made tasty with generous spicing. They have since evolved into a spiced fruit pie traditionally eaten at Christmas time. At Tivoli Road, we make about 140kg (300lb) of fruit mince for our pies, starting in March. We macerate the dried fruit for a couple of weeks, and then when the apple season starts we prepare and add those. Once a month for the next nine months, we give it a good stir and add some Pedro Ximenez. By Christmas we’ve got a rich, heady mix of plump fruit, liquor and spices. Pedro Ximenez isn’t traditionally used, but it adds a lovely rich flavour to the mince. To appease the traditionalists, we also use brandy and apple cider, rounding the flavour out nicely. When the first batch of pies comes out of the oven everyone around the bakery knows that Christmas is coming. Makes 24 pies Fruit mince Pastry : Start this recipe at least one month before you want to eat your mince pies. The longer you leave it, the more flavour the mince will have. Our head baker, Emily, also makes mince pies at home. She creates a suet-based mince mix each year, leaving some for the next year, and some for two years. The complexity of flavour in the two-year aged mince is incredible. Feel free to adjust the fruit, spices and alcohol to create a mince that suits your tastes. Write down your changes each year to develop your own family recipe. The pastry will keep in the fridge for a week, and three months in the freezer, wrapped well in plastic wrap or in a container. We use 6.5cm (2½ in) individual sized foil pie cases for our mince pies. You could use small shallow muffin tins instead, though you may need to adjust the sizes and quantities to suit. Place the currants, raisins and mixed peel in a large container with a lid, and stir to combine. Pour the brandy and cider over the fruit and stir it through. Leave the fruit to macerate in the alcohol at room temperature for at least a week or up to three weeks, stirring occasionally for the first few days to thoroughly distribute the liquid – you want it soaked through the fruit, not settled at the bottom of the container. Once your dried fruit has been soaking for a good week or three, prepare the rest of your filling. First place a colander over a large bowl, then heat a large frying pan over medium heat and sprinkle the brown sugar evenly into the pan. Leave it to melt, and when it starts to bubble, stir the sugar and add the diced apples. Continue stirring until the apples are well coated in caramel, then add the butter and stir for another 30 seconds to make sure that it’s melted and fully incorporated into the caramel. Transfer the apples to the colander to drain the liquid, and set aside to cool. The reserved liquid can either be discarded or kept to use as a delicious caramel sauce – it’s great over ice cream or apple crumble. It will keep in the fridge for up to one week. Once the apples have cooled completely, add them to the macerated fruit mix. Add the almonds, lemon juice and zest, spices and Pedro Ximenez, and mix well with a spoon. Leave the fruit mince to mature at room temperature for at least one month before assembling your mince pies. If keeping aside for longer, mix the fruit once a month, and add Pedro Ximenez or brandy to your liking each time. To make the pastry, place the flour and salt in a medium sized bowl and whisk to combine, and to remove any lumps. Gently cream the butter in a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, until smooth. Add the icing sugar and cream the butter and sugar together to form a paste, mixing on a slow speed to avoid incorporating air into the pastry. With the mixer still running, add the egg yolks one a time, beating between each addition until just combined. Add the dry ingredients in three batches, mixing slowly between each addition until just combined. Divide the dough into two pieces and flatten each out into a disc roughly 2cm (¾ in) thick. Wrap the pastry in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least one hour. Preheat the oven to 170°C (340°F). To make your egg wash, whisk together the egg, salt and milk. In a separate bowl, mix together the caster sugar and cinnamon. Lightly grease 24 6.5cm (2½ in) foil pie cases with a little butter. Lay your pastry discs out on a lightly floured bench, and roll each out into a sheet 2mm (1⁄10 in) thick. Cut out 24 discs of pastry with a diameter 2cm (¾ in) larger than the bottom of the pie cases, to form the bases. Next, cut out 24 discs of pastry the same diameter as the cases – these will be the tops of the pies. Lay the pastry bases over the pie cases, and use your thumb to press the pastry into the corners all the way around. Divide the fruit mince into 24 portions, and fill each case with mince. Lightly brush the rim of each case with the egg wash, place the pastry lid on top and gently press the two pieces of pastry together to seal the edges. Brush the top of each mince pie with egg wash and sprinkle with a little cinnamon sugar. The assembled pies can be refrigerated for up to five days before baking, or frozen for up to three months. Bake from frozen until the pastry is nicely golden all over. Place your mince pies onto baking trays and put them on the middle rack in the oven. Reduce the temperature to 160°C (320°F) and bake for 15 minutes, until the pastry is nicely golden. Gently lift one mince pie out of its case and check the pastry on the bottom, to ensure it is cooked through evenly. The pastry should be nice and golden both top and bottom. Transfer your mince pies to a wire rack and leave to cool slightly before eating. The mince pies will last for 3-5 days in an airtight container at room temperature, although the pastry will start to soften after a day or two. We use mixed peel in our Christmas pudding, Christmas cakes and our hot cross buns. It’s also lovely dipped in dark chocolate, for a simple homemade gift. This peel will keep for four to six months at room temperature Makes approx. 300g (10½ oz) Slice each piece of fruit into eight wedges, then slice the flesh out of each wedge to leave the peel with a little pith still on. Set aside the flesh for another purpose, and slice the peel into 4-5mm (¼ in-) wide strips. Put the peel in a heavy based saucepan pan, cover well with cold water and place the pan over high heat. Bring to the boil and then reduce the heat to simmer for five minutes. Drain the peel and return it to the pan. Cover again with cold water, bring to the boil, then reduce the heat to simmer for 30 minutes. Drain the liquid, reserving the water this time. Preheat the oven to its lowest temperature (about 60°C/140°F). Return the reserved water to the saucepan, making a note of its weight. Add an equal weight of sugar to the pan, reserving the remaining sugar, and place it over medium heat. Bring the mixture to the boil, stirring constantly until the sugar has dissolved. Add the peel and reduce to a simmer for 30 minutes, until the peel has softened and turned translucent. Leave the peel to cool slightly in the liquid for about 10 minutes. Line a tray with baking paper, and use a large slotted spoon to transfer the peel onto the tray. Discard the sugar syrup, or reserve it for another use. Spread the peel evenly over the tray in a single layer and bake for 30-40 minutes to remove any excess moisture. The texture of the peel will be quite leathery at this stage. Remove the peel from the oven. Place the remaining sugar in a medium-sized bowl, then gently toss the peel in the sugar a few pieces at a time until completely coated. Put the peel back on the tray, evenly spread in a single layer, and leave to dry at room temperature for several hours, preferably overnight.

" Wine prices in the UK are set to rise as a result of a Brexit, a study has claimed.  According to a paper published in the  , the amount that consumers would pay for a bottle of wine in a shop could go up by as much as 25 per cent by 2025 in the event of a hard Brexit. The increase in wine prices will consequently have an effect on the amount of wine consumed by Britons.  “The volume of UK wine consumption is 28 per cent lower: 16 per cent because of slower UK economic growth, 7 per cent because of real depreciation of the British pound, and 5 per cent because of new tariffs,” the paper states.  “Superpremium still-wine sales are the most affected, dropping by two fifths, while sparkling and commercial-premium wines drop a bit less than one quarter.” While some may opt for drinking homegrown British wine instead of imported wine due to the price increase, the solution may not be that simple. <p><b>Tesco Finest Bisol Prosecco - £8.99</b></p><p>Bisol have been producing Prosecco di Valdobbiadene for more than 100 years.

" Honey? Wine? Dark chocolate? Let us navigate you through the vegan minefield Veganism is on the march. With now more than half a million vegans in the UK, what does it actually mean? It might seem obvious what being vegan is, but there is even an app, Is It Vegan?, to check if certain products count or not. Simply scan a product and the app will analyse its ingredients and give you the thumbs up or down. Budding vegans and curious meat eaters may be wondering about the finer details about what the lifestyle entails. The definition of veganism, according to  , who coined the term in 1944, is:  “A philosophy and way of living which seeks to exclude—as far as is possible and practicable—all forms of exploitation of, and cruelty to, animals for food, clothing or any other purpose; and by extension, promotes the development and use of animal-free alternatives for the benefit of humans, animals and the environment. In dietary terms it denotes the practice of dispensing with all products derived wholly or partly from animals.” It is therefore more than just cutting out meat and dairy products, but a more comprehensive lifestyle choice striving to avoid animal cruelty and exploitation.  Although veganism objects to animal testing for the development of medicines, The Vegan Society doesn’t recommend you avoid drugs prescribed to you by your GP. Instead you can ask for medication that doesn’t include animal products such as gelatine and lactose. Honey is often mistaken as vegan friendly, but it definitely is not, because the harvesting of honey by humans exploits honey bees and their health can be damaged by a sugar substitute that beekeepers replace the honey with. The selective breeding of bees to increase productivity is also harming a species that is already endangered by increasing susceptibility to disease.  There may be condiments lurking in your cupboard that could catch you out. For example, some pestos contain milk and eggs and Lea & Perrins Worcestershire Sauce contains anchovies. Wine may have been filtered through a fining agent, which can include a range of animal products, including bone marrow, fish oil and gelatin. Avocado fans who are too lazy to make their own guac, beware: some supermarkets add cream to their guacamole. By contrast, there are tonnes of products that you would might not have thought are vegan, from Oreos (just leave the milk on the side), to Ritz cheesy crackers and some dark chocolate.  For all sorts of products, from beer to tattoo ink, animal charity PETA has published   to help you dodge the vegan minefield.  With the lifestyle itself cleared up, you may be wondering  . Due to the absence of red meat in a plant-based diet, vegans are typically deficient in vitamin B12 and iron, which can lead to headaches, dizziness and if left untreated, anaemia. In addition, you may feel tired, develop a calcium deficiency and go to the toilet more, but on the flipside you will probably lose weight and could reduce your risk of heart disease. Vegans can also take supplements to counteract the lack of vitamin B12, iron and calcium in their diet, so there's no need to fret. Now you know what being vegan means exactly, it’s probably best to stop asking  , which plague vegans’ daily lives. Jenny Liddle, former trustee of The Vegan Society, told   the most annoying things people say are: “‘Where do you get your protein? Oh but you won't be able to have that will you? It must be really hard being a vegan.’” Other nauseating comment include: “I couldn't be vegan - I love my bacon and cheese too much! I'm nearly vegan - I only eat chicken once a week! But what would happen if you were left in the desert and all you had to eat was your camel? But Lions eat meat. “These comments are irritating because they demonstrate a complete lack of understanding of my own standpoint, and a lack of respect,” Liddle said. “It seems to be acceptable to say these things even though veganism is a protected belief. It's basically bullying someone for being different, for having a different viewpoint from them.”  We use cookies to enhance your visit to our site and to bring you advertisements that might interest you.

 EPA At the time of publication, a single dogecoin is worth $0.015438, according to  .  There are 112,676,542,843 in circulation, however, which have an overall value of $1,739,477,933. On Sunday, the overall value of the currency reached more than $2bn.  The creator of dogecoin, Jackson Palmer, believes it is “worrying” that most conversations around digital currencies focus on the investment potential rather than the underlying technology. “I haven’t held a substantial amount of dogecoin since early-2015 so the market cap doesn’t mean a lot to me – it does however act as a barometer for crypto mania and speculation,” he   on Twitter. “I have a lot of faith in the dogecoin core development team to keep the software stable and and secure, but I think it says a lot about the state of the cryptocurrency space in general that a currency with a dog on it which hasn’t released a software update in over 2 years has a $1B+ market cap.” He also believes we’re in a bubble that will “inevitably” burst. “I think it’s relatively safe to label the current market as a ‘bubble’, although it’s hard to predict how much it’ll inflate and for how long before it inevitably bursts,” he added.  “My one hope is that when that does happen and people lose large sums of money, the negativity in the market doesn’t stifle technological innovation or interest in digital currency from the mainstream.” Dogecoin started as a parody named after an internet meme about a Shiba Inu dog. “Dogecoin is an open source peer-to-peer digital currency, favored by Shiba Inus worldwide,” dogecoin’s   reads. “’Doge’ is our fun, friendly mascot! The Shiba Inu is a Japanese breed of dog that was popularized as an online meme and represents dogecoin.” We use cookies to enhance your visit to our site and to bring you advertisements that might interest you.

" Gizmos and gimmicks are still around — but don't look to them for the future CES 2018 has kicked off. And with it comes all sort of tat — except, because it's the future, now that tat is connected to the internet. The Las Vegas spectacular is a gadget show, above all else, and there are thousands being released this week. In fact, it's the biggest gadget show in the world. But gadgets are ultimately a distraction. Toys might be fun, but they aren't where the future of technology can be seen. Instead, what matters is platforms: platforms for your house, platforms for your voice, platforms for your car, platforms for your entire reality. This is, in one sense, an easier war to have, since companies don't even necessarily have to actually make anything physical to win you around. Some companies still have to actually make the gadgets to access and live on the platforms, of course - but the real money is in allowing the smart home technology to talk to each other, not in manufacturing those things.

 EPA For all that, there are some big breakthroughs coming from CES this year. Here's where the most exciting stuff is, and what to expect. Virtual reality - which was always fairly gadgety, requiring people to strap things to their head and ensconce themselves in an entire world - was hyped lots and delivered little, at least so far. But gradually people are moving away from that approach, and into augmented reality. It is the ultimate platform: it doesn't even need other things to connect to it, since all it needs is a camera to see the world and a display to show you it with some more fun added on top. Luckily, you already have those in your phone. Apple - always a very noticeable absence from CES, along with an increasing number of important companies - has been working on its own AR platform. That works simply by using the iPhone's camera and the sensors embedded in it, projecting all manner of virtual worlds onto the real one. Now, other companies are developing platforms as well as the software that lives on those platforms. Gadgets will make use of these breakthroughs, of course — beautiful though the iPhone is, it can be described as a gadget, and what else was Google Glass? — but it's really the platforms that will be interesting. The home is the ultimate place for the gadget. It's also the biggest reason for people to resist them. When the idea of the connected home and the internet of things first caught on, it came in bizarre forms like web-controlled pet feeders and shoes that spy on you. (This is not entirely over — today a press release was sent out about a connected wine preservation system.) Gradually, with time, the gadgets have receded. As people let more of this kit into their house, they're also asking more of it -  , or  . The trouble is that people don't want gadgets in their house - they want kitchen appliances, furniture, fittings and accessories, not gadgets. Technology can enhance your domestic life, whereas gadgets only get in the way and fill up your house. And so companies have been gradually moving towards making existing things smart, not adding smart devices into people's houses. Philips' Hue smart lights, for instance, just fit into your existing lamps and light fixtures; Nest's smart smoke alarm fits in the same place as a normal one and is indistinguishable from it; Hive's internet-enabled thermostat works just like the decades-old one on your wall, apart from also having an app. Many people had forecast the emergence of the internet of things, but that appears to be wrong. What we're actually getting is just good things, empowered and improved by the internet. Stepping outside of the smart home, and into the car, reveals much the same move. Once, electric and semi-autonomous looked like strange, technological bugs; nowadays, manufacturers like Tesla are among those making the most beautiful, fast vehicles on the road. The battle to see whether those new upstarts will unseat the traditional car companies to build the electric vehicles is still ongoing. But it's clear what will decide the winners: which of them can build the best platforms for charging your car, and letting it drive itself; the hardware will matter, but the cars themselves are far from gadgets, with an intense focus on how they look and how they are built emerging from many of the companies currently building their vehicles of the future. For all of the above, CES remains a show mostly known for one thing: televisions. For a while, they tried being gadgets, with their various strange new features; then, they had a go at being platforms, with each company aiming to build its own smart TV technology that would make it easier to use than the rest. Now, they appear to have moved towards positioning themselves as the best thing for other platforms: clear, bright, advanced ways of letting people watch content from elsewhere. They might offer some future for the gadgets and their makers: if the future belongs to the platforms, they're going to need something to exist on. The winners are likely to be those gadgets that manage to hide what the really are. We use cookies to enhance your visit to our site and to bring you advertisements that might interest you.

" 'The remaining wreckage will fall into a designated area of the sea, without endangering the surface' China’s space station is not out of control and people living under it aren’t in danger, a leading Chinese engineer has said amid fears it could soon slam down to Earth. Repeated warnings have suggested that the space agency has lost control of its station and that it could plummet down to Earth. But it has told the public that it knows exactly what is going on with it. Tiangong-1, which translates as “heavenly palace”, was launched into orbit in 2011. Since then it has been undertaking experiments, in large part as a test to have a permanent station in space by 2023. From the International Space Station, Expedition 42 Flight Engineer Terry W. Virts took this photograph of the Gulf of Mexico and U.S. Gulf Coast at sunset Nasa This image of an area on the surface of Mars, approximately 1.5 by 3 kilometers in size, shows frosted gullies on a south-facing slope within a crater. The image was taken by Nasa's HiRISE camera, which is mounted on its Mars Reconaissance Orbiter Nasa The Orion capsule jetted off into space before heading back a few hours later — having proved that it can be used, one day, to carry humans to Mars Nasa The Soyuz TMA-15M rocket launches from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan on Monday, Nov. 24, 2014, carrying three new astronauts to the International Space Station. It also took caviar, ready for the satellite's inhabitants to celebrate the holidays Nasa NASA astronaut Reid Wiseman shared this image of Yellowstone via his twitter account Nasa Nasa celebrated Black Friday by looking into space instead — sharing pictures of black holes Nasa X-rays stream off the sun in this image showing observations from by NASA's Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope Array, or NuSTAR, overlaid on a picture taken by NASA's Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) Nasa This near-infrared color image shows a specular reflection, or sunglint, off of a hydrocarbon lake named Kivu Lacus on Saturn's moon Titan Nasa Although Mimas and Pandora, shown here, both orbit Saturn, they are very different moons. Pandora, small by moon standards (50 miles or 81 kilometers across) is elongated and irregular in shape. Mimas (246 miles or 396 kilometers across), a medium-sized moon, formed into a sphere due to self-gravity imposed by its higher mass Nasa An X1.6 class solar flare flashes in the middle of the sun in this image taken 10 September, captured by NASA's Solar Dynamics Observatory Nasa An image from Nasa's Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) shows a 200,000 mile long solar filament ripping through the Sun's corona in September 2013 Nasa A false colour image of Cassiopeia A comprised with data from the Spitzer and Hubble Space Telescopes and the Chandra X-Ray observatory Nasa An image of the Large Magellanic Cloud galaxy seen in infrared light by the Herschel Space Observatory. Regions of space such as this are where new stars are born from a mixture of elements and cosmic dust Nasa Nasa's Mars Rover Spirit took the first picture from Spirit since problems with communications began a week earlier. The image shows the robotic arm extended to the rock called Adirondack Nasa Nasa astronaut Scott Kelly captured this photograph of the green lights of the aurora from the International Space Station  The Space Shuttle Challenger launches from Florida at dawn. On this mission, Kathryn Sullivan became the first U.S. woman to perform a spacewalk and Marc Garneau became the first Canadian in space. The crew of seven was the largest to fly on a spacecraft at that time, and STS-41G was the first flight to include two female astronauts Galaxy clusters are often described by superlatives. After all, they are huge conglomerations of galaxies, hot gas, and dark matter and represent the largest structures in the Universe held together by gravity Nasa's Hubble Space Telescope has unveiled in stunning detail a small section of the Veil Nebula - expanding remains of a massive star that exploded about 8,000 years ago The arrangement of the spiral arms in the galaxy Messier 63, seen here in an image from the Nasa Hubble Space Telescope, recall the pattern at the center of a sunflower The spectacular cosmic pairing of the star Hen 2-427 — more commonly known as WR 124 — and the nebula M1-67 which surrounds it Four images from New Horizons’ Long Range Reconnaissance Imager (LORRI) were combined with colour data from the Ralph instrument to create this enhanced colour global view of Pluto The HiRISE camera aboard Nasa's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter acquired this closeup image of a fresh (on a geological scale, though quite old on a human scale) impact crater in the Sirenum Fossae region of Mars. This impact crater appears relatively recent as it has a sharp rim and well-preserved ejecta This photograph of the Florida Straits and Grand Bahama Bank was taken during the Gemini IV mission during orbit no. 19 in 1965. The Gemini IV crew conducted scientific experiments, including photography of Earth's weather and terrain, for the remainder of their four-day mission following Ed White's historic spacewalk on June 3 For 50 years, NASA has been suiting up for spacewalking. In this 1984 photograph of the first untethered spacewalk, NASA astronaut Bruce McCandless is in the midst of the first field tryout of a nitrogen-propelled backpack device called the Manned Maneuvering Unit (MMU) This Nasa Hubble Space Telescope image presents the Arches Cluster, the densest known star cluster in the Milky Way Nasa astronaut Reid Wiseman tweeted this photo from the International Space Station on 2 September 2014 On Mars, we can observe four classes of sandy landforms formed by the wind, or aeolian bedforms: ripples, transverse aeolian ridges, dunes, and what are called “draa” A sokol suit helmet can be seen against the window of the Soyuz TMA-11M capsule shortly after the spacecraft landed with Expedition 39 Commander Koichi Wakata of the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA), Soyuz Commander Mikhail Tyurin of Roscosmos, and Flight Engineer Rick Mastracchio of NASA near the town of Zhezkazgan, Kazakhstan Jupiter is the largest planet in the solar system and perhaps the most majestic. Vibrant bands of clouds carried by winds that can exceed 400 mph continuously circle the planet's atmosphere This Chandra X-Ray Observatory image of the young star cluster NGC 346 highlights a heart-shaped cloud of 8 million-degree Celsius gas in the central region It was supposed to be decommissioned in 2013, with a controlled destruction. That has been repeatedly delayed, however, leading to fears that it could be out of control and the Chinese space agency is simply waiting for it to fall back to Earth. If it did so and managed to land over a populated area, the remains of the space station that don’t burn up on re-entry could cause serious damage. Zhu Congpeng, a top engineer at the China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation, told the state-backed   newspaper that the space station was not crashing and did not pose a safety or environmental threat. “We have been continuously monitoring Tiangong-1 and expect to allow it to fall within the first half of this year,” Mr Zhu told the newspaper. “It will burn up on entering the atmosphere and the remaining wreckage will fall into a designated area of the sea, without endangering the surface,” he said. Re-entry was delayed in September 2017 in order to ensure that the wreckage would fall into an area of the south Pacific Ocean where debris from Russian and US space stations had previously landed, the paper said. The California-based Aerospace Corporation, a non-profit group that conducts federal research, said the Tiangong-1’s re-entry was unlikely to be controlled but was highly unlikely to hit people or damage property, according to a post on its website last updated 3 January. “Although not declared officially, it is suspected that control of Tiangong-1 was lost and will not be regained before re-entry,” it said. There may be hazardous material on board that could survive re-entry, it said. Advancing China’s space programme is a priority for President Xi Jinping, who has called for China to become a global space power with both advanced civilian space flight and capabilities that strengthen national security. Beijing insists that its space programme is for peaceful purposes, but the US Defence Department has said China’s programme could be aimed at blocking adversaries from using space-based assets during a crisis.

" Millions of computers and smartphones could be vulnerable to hackers  have been discovered by security researchers. The vulnerabilities, which were discovered by Google researchers last year, affect computer chips made by Intel, AMD and ARM, as well as the devices and operating systems running on them. According to the researchers, almost every computer released over the last 20 years could be vulnerable. However, there are straightforward steps you can take to protect yourself.

It is also working with hardware and software manufacturers across the wider technology industry.  “The issue has been mitigated in many products (or wasn’t a vulnerability in the first place),” the company  .  “In some instances, users and customers may need to take additional steps to ensure they’re using a protected version of a product.” Google says that Android smartphones and tablets that have the latest security updates are protected from the flaws. To check for available updates, go to Settings, System and System Update.

" The incredible story of how the tattooist of Auschwitz found love in the concentration camp has been told in a heart-wrenching new book. Lale Sokolov, born Ludwig “Lale” Eisenberg to Jewish parents in Slovakia in 1916, was admitted to Auschwitz concentration camp in 1942. He offered himself to the Nazis to spare the rest of his family, without knowing the horrors that lay within the soul-destroying death camp. Lale, now identified as prisoner number 32407, was forced to work in construction in the camp before contracting typhoid.  A French academic called Pepan took care of Lale while he was ill. Pepan, who had given Lale his numerical prisoner tattoo, made Lale his assistant and showed him the ropes with the tattoo supplies.  When Pepan disappeared one day, Lale was made the predominant tattooist of Auschwitz. While Lale was still a prisoner of Auschwitz, being the chief tattooist afforded him privileges such as extra rations and a single room.  on  However, he knew that he was lucky every day just to be alive.  “He did what he did to survive, Heather Morris, author of  , told the  . “He said you took whatever was being offered. You took it and you were grateful because it meant that you might wake up the next morning.” Of all the people that Lale was forced to tattoo, one made a remarkable impression on the tenacious man.  In July 1942, Lale was presented with the arm of a young girl, now to be known as prisoner number 34902. Decades later as he recollected his first encounter with his one true love, Lale told Morris that “as he tattooed her number on her left arm, she tattooed her number in his heart.” The girl in question was Gita Fuhrmannova, an inmate of the Birkenau women’s camp. Lale enlisted the help of an SS guard to smuggle letters to Gita and was even able to sneak extra rations to her and her friends. Lale used his advantageous position as chief tattooist to help as many people as he could. He was able to trade goods with local villagers so that he could afford more rations for those in need. When the Nazis began shipping prisoners out of Auschwitz in 1945, Gita disappeared without a trace. However, Lale never lost hope of reuniting with his long lost love. After being liberated from Auschwitz and returning to his family home, Lale made his way to Bratislava, a common place for concentration camp survivors to pass on their way back to Czechoslovakia. He was advised to try going to the Red Cross instead. However, he didn’t make it the whole way there.  While en route, lo and behold a familiar young woman stepped in front of his horse in the middle of the street. The Tattooist of   - and his secret love      Lale and Gita had found each other again at last and married in October 1945. After being imprisoned by the government for sending financial support for an Israeli state, the Sokolovs eventually made their way to Melbourne. The couple had a son, Gary, in 1961. The origins of their love story remained a secret that only a few friends were aware of up until Gita’s death in 2003. Lale passed away three years later in 2006, with the knowledge that people all over the world would finally learn of the extraordinary story of his and his wife's enduring love.

" Badass, kickass and everything else positive about the ass - that's the passionate, feminist entrepreneur who is determined to make her adult video company part of mainstream culture I first met Cindy Gallop after watching 40 minutes of sex. At a recent event at the Ace Hotel in Manhattan, Cindy, with her signature blonde bob and black jumpsuit, took to the stage. She introduced her company, Make Love Not Porn, and told us we were about to watch real couples having real sex. It was a celebration of the messiness and the awkwardness of real intimacy, she said, as well as a fabulous chance to see what everyone else is really doing in bed. She had also been working on the TV channel for four years and already made $500,000 revenue. We were going to watch sex together - now? I shifted in my chair and considered walking out. That was when she hit the play button. Read more We watched - delighted, horrified, aroused - as couples engaged in bedroom activity, including a lesbian couple alternately coughing on a dildo and a man masturbating in a sea cave. Some of the videos came with commentary: This is for you, John, or, God, doesn’t he have a nice bum? In one video, a marmalade cat jumped onto the bed and settled down for a nap while its two owners loudly reached climax. The cat flicked its tail, positively uninterested. Everyone laughed. After the showreel, Cindy insisted that the motivations and social dynamics of couples filming themselves were no different to couples who post pictures of their romantic weekend on Facebook. 'We are madly in love and here we are in Paris, kissing in front of the Eiffel Tower, or strolling along the Seine’, she said. 'With Make Love Not Porn, it’s here are, madly in love, and here’s the great sex we had in the hotel room'.    Yes, that was     🙂         Cindy is a champion and advocate for what she terms the sex tech revolution - any form of technology that disrupts, enhances or improves the human sexual experience. In her ideal world, her 200 MLNP stars would be as big as YouTube celebrities (FYI, she needs more content from gay men and couples of colour) and people would generate and source sharable content to learn about and enjoy sex online - all age appropriate, of course. But most social media websites shut down users for posting such content, another serious hurdle for Cindy’s business model. She pays the stars 50% of rental proceeds for videos that they film themselves, and which are vetted and curated by MLNP. The videos are protected by very strict privacy settings. If a couple breaks up, the videos are taken down. But the fear of what other people will think is a curse on innovation, Cindy said, and the journey has been a long slog. What is so frustrating for her is that the company could be a multi-million dollar platform.     Make Love Not Porn was born out of massive response to Cindy’s 2009 Ted Talk about her experience of dating younger men. I was the first person on Ted Talks to say 'come on my face' six times, she said proudly. It got 1.8 million views. She realised she had uncovered a massive social issue. The issue, she said, is when hardcore porn meets a reluctance to talk openly about sex, and porn becomes sex education.     “When you normalise sex, you end sexual abuse; when you talk openly about sex, you don’t bring Brock Turners into this world; you end a situation where perpetrators can rely on their victims’ shame and humiliation to not speak up, she said.  While men and even young boys are increasingly being fed hardcore porn, women grow up with chick-flicks, what Cindy calls a pink it and shrink it industry. Bollocks to that condescension, she said. That’s just because white guys are talking to other white guys at the top of the publishing and film industries. Women enjoy sex just as much as men and men are just as romantic as women. The vision and Cindy’s passion remains the same after nine years, but despite intense media coverage, she is still mostly known as the woman who talked about having sex with younger men. At her Fifth Avenue penthouse on two sleek grey sofas - again dressed in black leather - she said she decided to take ownership of the word cougar and make it into something positive.  We don’t have enough role models who demonstrate that you can live your life as you choose and still be happy, she said. Her one criteria for dating younger men on cougar websites? The young man has to be a really nice person. Empathy, loyalty and generosity are all qualities that should be applied in the bedroom - or the bathroom, living room or kitchen - just like in the office or down the pub. What happens, I asked tentatively, if you fall for one of these men? I’m not a relationship person, she replied. I actively look forward to dying alone. The Vesper designed by Ti Chang US sex toy designer Ti Chang The Vesper is produced in silver, rose gold and  gold. The PopDildo which can be used for semination  The Dame clitoral simulator designed by Gabrielle Pedriani   Like all serious entrepreneurs, her life appears to be dominated by work. After three decades in advertising, she spent the next raising cash for MLNP and travelling the world, speaking about the social sex revolution and convincing people that they want to buy gender diversity-friendly sex videos. Oh, God, Cindy said, briefly putting her face in her hands when I bring up the question of fundraising. I would never have wanted to fundraise again but the reason I have to is that there is often 'no adult content' in the small print and we need funding and resources to overcome that. But after nine years, she realised something - she had to invest in the infrastructure of the sex tech market. If you truly want to change shit up, you have to change the world to make it fit, she said.     That philosophy led to her next plan: to raise $10 million and launch a fund that invests in a small portfolio of sex tech companies. One of the companies will be MLNP. She also mentioned Tina Gong, who invented an app called HappyPlayTime for women to work out how to get themselves off. Also on the list is Dame, which invented a vibrator called Eva for women to use during penetrative sex, and wearable sex toy company Wisp - among its range is a bracelet which emits air onto your skin like a lover’s breath. Cindy’s vision is for the fund to hit $100 million.  I’m looking for people who understand what we are about and also those who want to make a shit ton of money, she said. She plans to expand the MLNP website (it's only 30 per cent finished) to include sexual education. No one, she said, is making money from sexual education, although it’s valuable work. Written erotica is also on the cards. She gets sent screeds of the stuff already. I’m so glad people write to us but oh my god it’s awful, she confided. The vocab is so limited. It’s cliche. So how long do women and men have to wait for this social sex revolution to become mainstream culture? Even women who post pictures of themselves breast-feeding their children are kicked off social media. We are going backwards as a society, she nodded. But at MLNP, we are a celebration of body positivity and intimacy. Couples and individuals tell us that they love themselves more after filming. Couples say the filming has transformed their relationships, because it forces them to talk to each other. In an age where everyone is insecure with their bodies and people are desperate for information, MLNP seems like a good place to start adopting Cindy’s philosophy of sexual education through demonstration”. Put simply, everyone in her videos is having a bloody good equal time. We use cookies to enhance your visit to our site and to bring you advertisements that might interest you.

" Doctor who administers the injection to women in the UK told   patients who had never experienced a vaginal orgasm did after receiving the injection Can you really increase and rejuvenate your sex life through an injection?  Apparently so, if the miracle claims of the ‘O-Shot’ are anything to believed. The shot, an abbreviation of The Orgasm Shot, is a non-surgical treatment which pledges to increase sexual arousal and “rejuvenate the vagina” - costing a hefty £1,000. Dr Sharif Wakil offers the procedure to his patients at the   in Harley Street, he was trained in its usage by the inventor of the shot Dr Charles Runels. Dr Wakil claims his patients had reported stronger and more frequent orgasms, increased natural lubrication and greater arousal after having the procedure which takes around 40 minutes, administered. The shot works by using platelets containing the patient’s own blood from their arm. This is then put in a special centrifuge which produces “high quality” Platelet Rich Plasma (PRP). It is injected into specific areas of the vagina, and patients can just have one shot or come back for more which will build on the existing PRP. The Vesper designed by Ti Chang US sex toy designer Ti Chang The Vesper is produced in silver, rose gold and  gold. The PopDildo which can be used for semination  The Dame clitoral simulator designed by Gabrielle Pedriani   “The PRP generated in the centrifuge contains cell regenerating growth factors which, when injected into the vagina, trigger stem cells to increase blood flow and generate healthy tissue growth as well as helps improve the vascularization of the area,” Dr Wakil told  The doctor, who is credited with having treated cricketer Sir Ian Botham’s openly-discussed impotence problem, says he has treated around 2,000 patients so far both in the UK and globally.  He has seen the request for the orgasm shot on the rise recently, which he attributes partly to positive patient testimonials.  “The rise of non-surgical genital rejuvenation, in general, has increased a lot due to the advanced technology that is now present and patients now started to be informed but we are still in a very early stage. “The fact that women finally heard about a treatment that can at least help them regain some of their sensitivity as there was nothing at all in the market for that. Dr Wakil says the main reasons women are requesting the shot are to increase sensitivity, because they used to have orgasms and now do not, they are experiencing urinal incontinence or lichen sclerosis - a condition which affects the skin of the genitals. Some women who chose the procedure might suffer from female sexual arousal disorder which has shown to affect 1 in 20 women according to some studies, they might be unable to achieve an orgasm, potentially because they have an orgasm disorder. Other women who opt for the shot may do so because they are experiencing pain during sex which nearly one in 10 British women experience, a recent study suggested.  Dr Wakil says patients have reported a range of positive effects from the shots including increased sensation, greater arousal from clitoral stimulation, the ability to have an orgasm from penetrative sex when they were previously unable to, younger and smoother skin of the vulva, stronger and more frequent orgasms, improvement in urinary incontinence, decreased pain for those experiencing painful sex, increased natural lubrication and the increased ability to have a vaginal orgasm.  “The results in general of the o shot varies, I always explain to my patients, it depends on where we are at the starting point, for example, their age, if they have medical conditions or  whether they have hormonal problems.” He stresses the injection is not a magic stick and that 50 per cent of women might experience instantaneous wow effects while the other half may just notice a marked improvement, which they can build on by having more injections.  Are there any risks with injecting such a highly sensitive area? Dr Wakil says all injections carry certain risks such as bleeding, infection and damaging the nerve endings but claims he has never seen any side effects in the 2,000 cases he has personally administered. He has treated a range of women from their mid-twenties to early sixties and warned that continuing stigmas around the female orgasm and female can deter women coming forward for help or treatment if they are experiencing gynaecological or sexual problems. He suggests this problem is a form of sexism.  “I always give the following example to my patients,” he explains. “As we grow older, our sights get impaired so we wear glasses, our hearing might get weaker so we wear hearing aids, this is no different. This is a part of the female body that sees a lot of changes through life: from delivery, menopause, hormonal changes, and aging. So we have to expect some reduction in sensation at least for some but we should not treat this is as an abnormality. The abnormality is not seeking help because of a stigma, in my opinion, ignoring female sexual dysfunction with the negative effects it could have on the female life, family, socially and work for example is one form of female abuse.

" The envelopes were delivered to around 60 homes A ‘real life Santa’ has posted thousands of pounds through people’s letter boxes on Christmas Day in a random act of kindness. Families have reported how an anonymous man slipped wads of cash through doors around Linden Close in Walsall, West Midlands as the clock struck midnight.  Thought to be delivered to around 60 homes, on the outside of every envelope were the words, ‘Jesus loves you.’ One lucky recipient, Kirsty Tapper, 26, recalls how she heard her letterbox rattle at around midnight before finding an envelope filled with £50 in cash on her doormat. When she went outside to see who had posted the generous gift, Tapper was met with a series of other neighbours who also received cash-filled letters.  “It's an amazingly generous thing to do and I am sure this man had helped make Christmas for a lot of people. He's a real life Santa Claus,” Tapper told  .  ”It really lifts your spirits to think that a total stranger would give away so much money at a time when cash can be so tight.“ A member of the Iraqi security forces holds a lit candle at Christmas Mass in a church won back from Isis on the outskirts of Mosul REUTERS/Ammar Awad German tourists Mimi Wiebeling (L) and Pauline Lapetite carry surfboards as they walk into the surf wearing Christmas hats at Sydney's Bondi Beach on Christmas Day in Australia, December 25, 2016.

" It’s time to wrestle back control of your festive finances You may not yet have de-Christmassed but its £20bn price-tag is probably already playing havoc with your money. At estimated eight million of us will fall behind in our finances this January as a result of   costs, not least because the credit card bill is likely to land before the long awaited paycheck. With the average individual bill coming in at more than £750 and more than a third of us using credit to cover the costs for last month’s revelry, one in four Brits is keen to do more to save up in advance of next Christmas according to the Money Advice Trust. But with saving club controversy and painfully low interest rates playing on our minds, what are the best options for those heeding the warnings to “make a plan” for 12 months’ time? The saying goes that to eat the proverbial elephant you have to take small bites. The same is true of the somewhat daunting Christmas budget. “The key to making Christmas 2018 even more prosperous is to start putting a little aside each month, and to find the best rates available,” says Anna Bowes, director of independent savings advice site Savings Champion. “Regular   are a great way to get into a savings discipline and often offer the best rates available. However, the very best tend to be linked to a current account with that provider and will have a 12-month term, so if you are starting today, you’d not have access to the money before Christmas.” Leeds Building Society, however, has a regular saver which is available to all and allows one easy access withdrawal before maturity – which is 30 December 2018. One of the best regular saver accounts available is with Nationwide Building Society – and while the term is 12 months, it does offer easy access. It’s Flexclusive Regular Saver is currently paying 5 per cent, although this rate is variable and you can only one if you also have a main current account with them. “However the Nationwide FlexDirect current account also pays 5 per cent on balances of up to £2,500, so is a really good option to consider too,” adds Bowes. “There are terms and conditions that must be adhered to in order to earn this rate – but it can be rewarding.” Save £250 per month into the Nationwide Flexclusive Regular Saver and the estimated balance after 12 months would be £3,081.25. If you are starting to save, then the interest earned is really just the cherry on the top in the early years – the actual discipline of saving on a regular basis is the key to having an extra lump sum next Christmas. “However, if you already have savings, by again choosing the best rates of  , you can enjoy more interest to spend,” she adds. “If you had placed £85,000 in the NatWest Instant Saver at the beginning of December 2016, you would have had £8.50 in gross interest to spend at Christmas 2017, as opposed to £974.07 if you had monitored and switched to the best easy access account throughout the year.” Even sticking with the best buy account at the outset – RCI Bank’s Freedom Account – you would have earned £969 before tax. For those who didn’t need access to their savings, a fixed rate bond paying up to 1.40 per cent gross/AER for 12 months would have earned £1,190 in gross interest. “Rates are better now than they were 12 months ago,” Bowes notes. “If you were to choose a one-year fixed rate bond today, you could earn 1.85 per cent (with the Investec 1 Year Fixed Term Deposit – min £25,000) which will give you £1,572.50 gross when it matures next year.” The best easy access account is still RCI Bank, which, along with Post Office Money, is currently paying 1.30 per cent. If that rate were to remain the same between now and next Christmas your £85,000 would earn £1,105 gross over the next 12 months. But what of the Noughties classic – the Christmas saving club. They are still out there, but vary considerably in structure and protection. “The idea is that you save throughout the year and you can spend your money from November onwards. You may be able to get earlier access, but there could be a penalty – and any bonus you get is paid in November and linked to the amount on your account then,” warns Sarah Pennells of Savvywoman.co.uk. “Supermarket Christmas savings schemes are the most generous. Tesco’s Clubcard Savings Scheme pays a bonus equivalent to up to 6 per cent in interest while Asda and Co-op pay a bonus of up to around 4 per cent. With these schemes though, you have to keep tight hold of your paperwork. If you lose your Asda card and you’ve not registered it, or you lose your Co-op stamp book, the money you’ve saved is gone. Your savings will be held in ring-fenced accounts, but it’s not protected in the way bank and building society savings are. Run by and for members, several of these community savings schemes offer Christmas accounts. Your money is protected by the UK’s savings compensation scheme up to £85,000 per credit union and you may get a dividend. The only problem is you won’t usually know how much it will be in advance and some credit unions are paying dividends of below 1 per cent. “Farepak going bust in 2006 put traditional Christmas savings clubs in the spotlight for all the wrong reasons as hundreds of thousands of people lost money,” says Pennells. “The two big Christmas savings clubs, Park and Variety, are members of the Christmas Prepayment Association (set up after Farepak collapsed). They keep money saved in ring-fenced accounts.  “Unlike the supermarkets, there’s no bonus. You can use your savings to buy food hampers, gift cards or toys. But if you buy gift cards and the shop issuing them goes bust, you could lose money on your card. “The supermarket schemes are the most generous so if you’re loyal to one store it could be worth saving. If you want the best protection for your cash, pick a credit union.” We use cookies to enhance your visit to our site and to bring you advertisements that might interest you.

" Since May, NOA has been streaming recordings of professional broadcasters reading a selection of articles from media partners, including The Independent Shane Ennis knew he and co-founder Gareth Hickey were onto something with News Over Audio (NOA), their audio  -streaming startup, when   launched  . “We realised this wasn’t going to be just an audio app; that there were other places where this content could live,” Ennis says down the phone from Dublin. The two founders came up with NOA to make newspaper content live beyond the page. Since May, NOA has been streaming recordings of professional broadcasters reading a selection of articles from media partners, including  The   and the  . Bloomberg joined the service in June and the founders say the publisher count will double in 2018. But even they were surprised by the timeliness of their idea. From December, users can connect to NOA through Amazon’s Alexa. Its founders envisage a future where users wake up to the news through their alarm, listen on their way to work in their connected car, and activate Alexa to keep reading them stories through the workday. An economic rebalancing of the over-centralised UK is welcomed by many, but not when it comes to the specifics. Labour’s proposal to move “some functions” of the BoE to Manchester was taken out of context argues    Ennis, now 26, and Hickey, 27, conceived of NOA as a way to keep up with newspapers for people who don’t have the time to sit down and read them. They were both in their early twenties at the time, with fast-paced, corporate careers. Hickey worked as an equity analyst at Susquehanna International Group, a financial firm, and Ennis was working at   as a resourcing analyst and freelancing as a developer.  “We just couldn’t find the time to read,” Hickey says. “We were too busy or perhaps too distracted. Audiobooks addressed this issue in one market, but journalism lacked a similar solution.” They wanted to be “in the know, to be informed”, Hickey says. “Shane knew about what was current in technology, science and business, me about what was going on in Ukraine, the Middle East, and politics,” he says. “Like many millennials, we felt lost in the constant stream of headlines and information.” In 2014, they came across the  ’s   edition, a spoken-word version of the magazine, and “fell in love”, Hickey says. “Our natural reaction at the time was simply to see who else provided a similar audio-journalism offering, albeit on a larger scale – essentially, what we wanted to know was: who was the Spotify of journalism? After a while searching one evening we realised that the answer was nobody.”  So why could it not be them? Ennis, who had paid his way through university by developing websites, began working on an app that could provide users with audio versions of newspaper and magazine articles. Hickey meanwhile concentrated on building a network of publishers and a few investors to launch the project. “We pretty much designed, developed and built the brand between the two of us, the idea is from the two of our skills,” Ennis says. Most listened on NOA this morning: Black Friday is a retail industry trick played on gullible consumers, by   via    Using their own money and a small amount of seed funding from several investors, Ennis and Hickey built a system where they could upload selected articles for a team of professional readers. The readers – there are currently five spread across the Ireland and the UK – send back the audio files which are uploaded for listeners, often on the same day an article is published. They based the business model loosely on  , where users have access to several articles for free alongside advertising, before they are asked to “convert” to a subscription of €8 (£7) a month. So far their conversion rate is around 30 per cent of users who listen to four or more articles per weekday.  NOA struck a deal with publishers to provide them with audio content in return for hosting that content on the platform. They timed the proposition exactly right, Hickey says, when many publishers were already expanding into podcasting and curious about audio: “The reaction from the publishers was very positive. They were all talking about audio and what their audio strategy was going to be; we heard those two words a lot.” They worked with publishers to select articles for the service, but quickly discovered that opinion pieces and features, which read more like a story, work best. “Our early testing revealed that comment, feature, analysis and opinion pieces lent themselves far better to audio than, say, a more newsy article. Stories that are highly numeric or complex can also make for uncomfortable listening.” At the moment publishers help the founders select articles that are doing well online, but there are plans to grow a team of editors to handle curation as NOA expands. Ennis and Hickey are also nurturing relationships with other companies curious about Alexa. Within weeks of launching, the founders had been approached by a German carmaker about the possibility of integrating the service into its entertainment system. Hickey says: “We are early stages, I’m confident that we’re going in the right direction.” We use cookies to enhance your visit to our site and to bring you advertisements that might interest you.

" Both retailers managed to grow their sales by an impressive 16.8 per cent at the end of 2017 compared to the same period last year German discounter duo   and   shared the title of Britain’s fastest growing supermarket in the three months to the end of December, figures published by Kantar Worldpanel on Tuesday revealed. Both retailers managed to grow their sales by an impressive 16.8 per cent compared to the same period last year, taking Aldi’s share of the entire UK grocery market to 6.8 per cent from 6 per cent a year earlier, and Lidl’s to 5 per cent from 4.4 per cent in December 2016. Aldi last week posted a 15 per cent rise in UK sales for December, taking total annual sales across the UK and Ireland  . On a similarly upbeat note, Lidl earlier this week announced that it plans to  , creating some 1,000 jobs, to support five new stores expected to open across Greater London. “In some ways Christmas is a tricky time for the discounters: they tend to lose a little market share compared to earlier in the year as many shoppers return to the more traditional supermarkets in search of old favourites,” said Fraser McKevitt, head of retail and consumer insight at Kantar Worldpanel. “Rising to the challenge, Aldi and Lidl collectively managed to attract nearly one million additional households during the past three months,” he added. Of the UK’s four big supermarkets,   was the fastest growing in the 12 weeks to the end of December, with sales up 3.1 per cent. Kantar said that this was the fastest sales growth the retailer has seen since June, helped by a 6.4 per cent increase in sales of standard Tesco own label. It said that with Christmas Day falling on a Monday, Tesco Express, like other convenience stores, were able to benefit from restricted Sunday opening hours for larger supermarkets and were able to capitalise on consumers wanting to do their shopping closer to home during the busy festive season. Nonetheless, Tesco’s overall market share inched 0.2 percentage points lower to 28 per cent. Asda managed to grow sales by 2.2 per cent, but also suffered a 0.2 per cent loss of market share to 15.3 per cent. Morrisons’ share fell by the same amount to 10.7 per cent and Sainsbury’s declined by 0.3 percentage points to 16.4 per cent. Kantar also found that overall online supermarket sales enjoyed their biggest ever Christmas, with a 4.9 per cent surge compared to the same period last year.

" In 2018, scrutiny over technology platforms like Uber and Airbnb will step up a notch, according to experts, as people turn to socially invested alternatives From craft-makers earning cash on   to people lending their eyes to a blind person on  : our IndyVenture column about startups and enterprises has this year often featured the collaborative economy. The term “collaborative economy” emerged two years ago to describe giving, sharing or swapping services for a fee. It was initially hailed as a revolution in the way we access taxis, holiday accommodation and other goods and services. It appeared to put power into the hands of workers who got greater freedom to choose their hours and charges. Yet in the time since, Uber, Airbnb and other platforms that host these workers have come under increasing scrutiny for offering few rights or protections for the drivers and hosts that sustain them. In 2018, that scrutiny will step up a notch, according to Alice Casey, senior development manager at think tank  . It will turn into direct action on the part of workers who begin to look for more socially beneficial platforms on which to do business. “A lot of energy’s gone into directing people away from the tech giants and a dispute about how gig work happens,” Casey says. “We think with any innovation, there is a point where people look again at it and at different approaches. People more interested in social benefits are starting to take the lead.” Casey says taxi drivers are already turning away from the larger technology platforms and forming co-operatives, where each driver has a stake in the company.  , founded by black cab drivers in London, allows black cabs to have the same accessibility and convenience as Uber by providing an on-demand, cashless service.  “On a Saturday night, people don’t care too much how they get home and I understand that,” Taxiapp founder Sean Paul Day  in August. “But there’s something about Taxiapp that is empowering. The energy for it is good – you’re actually doing something that is positive for the industry. That is the momentum.”  It’s not just altruism that makes these platforms a better option. Co-operatives, where each member shares ownership, flips traditional collaborating economy platforms to distribute profits among members or as the members decide, rather than among shareholders or owners. CareShare, a co-operative founded in 2017, has the potential to transform social care by matching the needs of those in care with caregivers, who can choose whether they want to be self-employed or pay into employee benefits. , a stock photo agency from Canada founded in 2012 to pay artists fairly, rather than simply profit from their work, is structured as a co-operative. It offers some of the highest royalties in the industry and paid out $200,000 (£150,000) in dividends to members in 2015 after it doubled revenue to $7.9m. Another platform co-operative called   donates surplus cash to improve neighbourhoods where rental properties are located.  Alex Stephany, founder of a crowdfunding platform for the homeless called  , calls this next-generation collaborative economy “co-operatives 2.0” – in his book,  . He says: “There could be a long-term shift to an Uber owned by the drivers, or an Airbnb owned by the hosts. Those things will happen but it will take time and tech to be even more commoditised.” “I need to live as a human. 
- Meet Adam, our newest Beam member. He's brilliant at Maths and is training up to become an accountant. This is his story.    Stephany says the transition to a fairer collaborative economy depends on costs: “If the cost of tech and building these platforms falls and if regulation becomes increasingly financially costly for the large Ubers, we may see this model take off,” he says.  He points to crowdfunding as one option for such platforms to get off the ground: “So far amounts of crowdfunding are drops in the ocean compared to a private equity fund. It’s hard for an Uber owned by drivers to compete. That might change. I can imagine much larger rounds of funding becoming more democratised.” Before she worked at Nesta, Alice Casey was a director at  , a funding platform for community enterprises, create startups and charities. She says the development of the collaborative economy mirrors earlier shifts in crowdfunding, away from tech startups like Kickstarter and towards more socially invested models. Crowdfunder, for example, was set up by 1,000 shareholders committed to investing in changes they want to see, including Nesta, Creative England and Crowdcube, Stephany’s own startup, Beam, is built on new ideas about crowdfunding and the collaborative economy. Beam is a crowdfunding platform that asks groups of people to raise funds for vocational training for homeless people. Beam members write down their “stories” of homelessness and appeal for donations to help fund training. The platform collects £1 in every £11 donated to go towards running costs but relies on grants, including previous grants from Nesta and the Mayor of London, to stay afloat. “The beauty of the model is we are able to raise funds and spend them on employment training or barriers to employment, like childcare for a single mum, or a hard hat for someone who wants to get into construction. It’s new financial capital, but also new social networks,” says Stephany. While projects compete for funding on traditional crowdfunding platforms, donors to Beam can choose to spread their donation between members. Stephany says. “It’s different to other crowdfunders that are competitive, sink or swim arrangements. That’s not the case at all with Beam, we are the least competitive crowdfunding campaign in history.” Beam has had 13 members and nine campaigns in the 11 weeks since it launched. Stephany says that rather than replacing housing benefit or government grants to local councils that fund local housing initiatives, Beam gives people a chance to “do their civic duty”. “I don’t think we can expect government to do everything,” he says. “This is particularly the case with innovation in technology.” But Casey says local and city governments must create the right conditions for a collaborative economy. “We’re not saying that these will take over from commercial platforms, but they have a place in the market for people working in a more socially innovative way,” she says. “That might be a centrally owned technology platform to allow people to access resources.” More than anything, it will rely on a free an open web, unfettered by the interests of private companies.  We use cookies to enhance your visit to our site and to bring you advertisements that might interest you.

" Businesses must shoulder the burden for recycling their own packaging, according to Suez’s UK boss The chief executive of one of the biggest waste and recycling operations in the UK has said that while   may provide a helpful nudge to consumers to abandon a throwaway culture, they won’t bring about lasting change in isolation. David Palmer-Jones, the boss of French company Suez’s recycling arm in Britain, said that to really move the needle on the issue, proposals like the one unveiled by MPs on Friday need to form part of a “wider, joined-up reform that shifts the burden of responsibility for all forms of packaging content, recyclability and ultimately their collection, back to the producer.”  Mr Palmer-Jones added that although disposable coffee cups only represent a small fraction of the national annual tonnage of card and plastics waste, “they leave the worst taste-reminder of how on-the-go consumption can result in needless waste of our precious natural resources”.  He said that for the so-called “latte levy” to be more than just “a light and frothy foam nod to reform” the UK needs to invest more in sustainable product design, use more recyclable materials and be better at “capturing” materials at the end of their life. Suez recycling and recovery in the UK serves around 12 million people and handles around 10 million tonnes of waste each year. Earlier this week,   that it will start offering customer a 50p discount on the price of hot drinks if they bring their own cup. On Friday Starbucks said that it would start a three-month trial of a 5p paper cup charge in up to 25 London shops from next month. Back in 2016 it trialled applying a 50p discount for customers using reusable cups, but it said that this “did not move the needle in the way we thought it might”. Estelle Brachlianoff, a senior executive at Veolia – another French-owned resource management company with major operations in the UK – also said that more needs to be done. “We want to see incentives for manufacturers which use recycled materials to give products a second life,” said Ms Brachlianoff. “We believe the solution lies in collaboration and at Veolia we want to ensure sustainability throughout the entire supply chain, including designers, manufacturers, processors and consumers,” she said.  We use cookies to enhance your visit to our site and to bring you advertisements that might interest you.

" Dogecoin was created in 2013 and took its name from a meme based around pictures of dogs with garbled captions that relay the animal’s supposed internal monologue A cryptocurrency that started as a parody named after an internet meme about a Shiba Inu dog now has a market value of more than $1.2bn (£900m). After a long period of stagnation, dogecoin has increased in value more than five-fold in the last month as the  . The rapid rise demonstrates the mania that has engulfed digital coins and has worried even dogecoin's creator.  Jackson Palmer told Coindesk, a website that tracks cryptocurrency news and prices, that he had faith in the development team behind dogecoin’s technology, but that it “says a lot about the state of the cryptocurrency space in general that a currency with a dog on it which hasn't released a software update in over two years has a $1bn-plus market cap”.   He added that the fact that most conversations about cryptocurrencies in the media concern investment and the potential to make money “draws attention away from the underlying technology and goals this movement was based [on]. Dogecoin was created in 2013 and took its name from a meme based around pictures of Shiba Inu dogs with garbled captions that relay the animal’s supposed internal monologue. Love the logo for   indeed.    It began as a way to poke fun at the growing hype surrounding cryptocurrency. Now it seems it has been swept up in the latest round of that very same hype. “Dogecoin is an open source peer-to-peer digital currency, favored by Shiba Inus worldwide,” the cryptocurrency’s  . The creators are listed as Mr Palmer, along with “Shibetoshi Nakamoto”, a play on the alias of the founder of bitcoin, who is known as Satoshi Nakamoto. All of the developers who work on dogecoin’s technology are reportedly volunteers. One of the team, Max Keller, told Coindesk that it was “a little scary” to find himself working on software that powers a billion-dollar network.  “This is quite the responsibility,” he added. “Still, I am proud of what we achieved and thankful to be part of such a great community.  - Bitcoin has been at the centre of the cryptocurrency craze as its value has risen more than 12-fold this year but it has been significantly outperformed by a smaller rival which has seen its value rise by that amount in less than three weeks. XRP, a cryptocurrency created by the fintech company Ripple is easily the best performing cryptocurrency of 2017, registering astonishing 37,000 per cent gains $0.0065 per token in January 2017, to $2.47 by the end of the year.  The rise has potentially catapulted its creator, Chris Larsen, high up the world’s rich list. Mr Larsen owns 5.19bn XRP coins, according to a report by Forbes, which would mean his holding is worth $12.82bn (£9.4bn). Bitcoin is a digital currency created in 2009 by a mysterious figure using the alias Satoshi Nakamoto. It can be used to buy or sell items from people and companies that accept bitcoin as payment, but it differs in several key ways from traditional currencies. Most obviously, bitcoin doesn’t exist as a physical currency. There are no actual coins or notes. It exists only online.  “Real-world” currencies, like the dollar, are managed by a central bank such as the US Federal Reserve or the Bank of England, which manage the money supply to keep prices steady. They can print more money or withdraw some from circulation if they think it’s needed, as well as using other monetary policy controls such as adjusting interest rates.  Bitcoin has no central bank and isn’t linked to or regulated by any state. The supply of the cryptocurrency is decentralised – it can only be increased by a process known as “mining”. For each bitcoin transaction, a computer owned by a bitcoin “miner” must solve a difficult mathematical problem. The miner then receives a fraction of a bitcoin as a reward. The use of problem-solving in this way is the reason bitcoin is known as a cryptocurrency. We use cookies to enhance your visit to our site and to bring you advertisements that might interest you.

" The first working Monday of the new year usually sees a rise in the number of couples seeking a divorce following the stress of the festive season  Money worries are the leading cause of   falling apart, according to a new study, the release of which coincides with what is reportedly the busiest time of year for separations. The first working Monday of the year is dubbed “Divorce Day” by lawyers because of the increase in the number of people looking to end their marriages following the stress of Christmas and the New Year. A poll of over 2,000 British adults by legal firm Slater and Gordon found that money worries top the list of reasons why married couples split up, with one in five saying it was the biggest cause of marital strife. “Although it is a happy time for many, relationships which are already showing cracks are likely to buckle under the added pressure and expense that Christmas brings,” said Lorraine Harvey, family lawyer at Slater and Gordon. Over a third of those questioned said that financial pressures were the biggest challenge to their marriage, while a fifth said that most of their arguments were about money. One in five of those polled blamed their partner for their money worries, accusing them of overspending or failing to budget properly. The latest figures available from the Office for National Statistics show that 107,000 heterosexual couples   in 2016 – up 5.8 per cent from the previous year. “Money is always a common issue and if one person feels that their partner is not pulling their weight financially or at least trying to then it can very quickly cause resentment to grow,” said Ms Harvey. “I think many people see Christmas as their last shot at making a marriage work, but with all the added pressure and the perception that everyone else around them is happy it makes it even more difficult and is probably the worst time of the year to try,” she added. Relationships charity Relate said it receives a peak in calls every year as relationship pressures escalate over Christmas.  The charity said that in January 2017, calls to its national phone line went up 24 per cent compared to the average month, and it said it was expecting a similar increase this year. “The reality is that many of the calls we receive in January are from couples who are already at crisis point after existing relationship tensions have come to a head over Christmas,” said Relate’s chief executive Chris Sherwood. “With one in five people in the UK in a ‘distressed relationship’, we’d urge anyone who isn’t getting on with their partner to seek support as early as possible,” he added.   We use cookies to enhance your visit to our site and to bring you advertisements that might interest you.

" Same store sales, excluding fuel, rose 2.8 per cent in the ten weeks to 7 January. Including fuel, sales were up 3 per cent  has reported a jump in sales for the crucial Christmas and New Year period, helped by a surge in online activity and a cap on prices despite rising commodity prices. The supermarket on Tuesday said that same store sales, excluding fuel, rose 2.8 per cent in the ten weeks to 7 January. Including fuel, sales were up 3 per cent. “More and more customers found more things they wanted to buy at competitive prices at Morrisons this Christmas,” said chief executive David Potts. “The hard work and friendliness of our colleagues continues to be key in delivering our strengthening performance,” he added. Morrisons said that automated ordering was live across all stores during the period, which helped improve availability and stock levels. It said that despite commodity prices rising, the cost of a basket of typical Christmas items was unchanged from last year. Online sales rose by 10 per cent as the retailer expanded the number of stores where customers could pick up good ordered on the internet. It also said that wholesale growth was strong, helped by supplying some tobacco products to the retailer’s new partner, McColl’s, earlier than initially planned. Morrisons had previously announced that it would start supplying all McColl’s stores with Safeway products and national brands. That process will start this month. Retail trading updates for the Christmas period have so far been mixed. John Lewis last week revealed   during the week running up to Christmas, and Poundland and Next also reported upbeat figures, but Debenhams said that profits for the full year would likely be   as a result of a lacklustre performance. Separately on Tuesday, figures compiled by the British Retail Consortium and KPMG showed that   across the UK in December. Analysts said that rising inflation and stagnant   growth had squeezed shoppers and forced them to spend a greater proportion of their budgets on essential food items.

" We know that alcohol is carcinogenic to humans, but new research on genetically modified mice suggests it changes the DNA in our vital stem cells After cigarettes, alcohol is perhaps the most common carcinogen that humans voluntarily expose themselves to. How this simple substance promotes  , though, has not been clear. But our latest study, using genetically modified mice, sheds some light on the possible mechanism. Our previous research revealed the principle mechanism that protects us from  . The first level of this protection consists of an enzyme that converts acetaldehyde – a toxic by-product created in the body when alcohol is metabolised – into a harmless substance. The second level of protection consists of a repair system that fixes the damage that acetaldehyde causes to DNA. Now we have extended this work to show how alcohol, and subsequently its toxic by-product, damages the DNA of the cells that supply blood – the blood stem cell. Inherited gene defects that impair this protection mechanism are common in humans. About 500 million people in South-east Asia don’t have the biological system for dealing with acetaldehyde (the first level of protection). People from this region often get a flushed complexion after drinking alcohol and they often feel unwell. They are also at increased risk of oesophageal cancer. We show that mice that have been genetically modified to emulate this loss of protection accumulate four times more DNA damage in their blood cells after exposure to a single dose of alcohol, so they are highly reliant on the DNA repair system to ensure that these cells don’t accumulate irreversible DNA damage. Although it is quite rare, some people lack the DNA repair system (level two protection) that undoes the damage. They suffer from a devastating illness called Fanconi’s anaemia that leads to premature death due to loss of blood production, blood cancer and other types of cancer. Using mice that lack both protection mechanisms, we show conclusively that alcohol exposure causes damage to the chromosomes in the blood cells resulting in rearrangements of their chromosomes – the structures in the nucleus of the cells where DNA is packaged. Using state-of-the-art DNA sequencing technology, we deciphered the genomes of the rare stem cells that supply the blood in these mice and show how they are altered by this damage. Damage to the genome of stem cells may cause them to malfunction. However, because these vital cells give rise to a large number of specialised blood cells, the altered genome of single stem cells can be transmitted to many daughter cells. Altered genomes ultimately lead to altered genes, which, in some instances, cause cells to become cancerous. We have primarily studied the blood cells in our mice, but we can’t say for certain that alcohol causes blood cancers. However, it is well-known that alcohol does affect the production of blood. Our results explain, to some extent, why this happens. The main advantage of studying blood is that it is easy experimentally to examine. This is particularly the case for the blood stem cells, which can be quantified and functionally assessed by a technique known as bone marrow transplantation. This involves transplanting stem cells that one may wish to assess into a mouse that no longer has such cells. Over time the transplanted stem cells start producing new blood and the efficacy of doing so relates to the fitness of the transplanted stem cell. So the analysis of blood stem cells provides a window into how alcohol may damage other stem cells in the body, such as those that make the gut and the liver. Our new research explains how alcohol damages DNA in our vital stem cells. Although we show that this damage is limited by a robust protection mechanism, inherited dysfunction of this mechanism is common in humans. Nevertheless, it is also important to stress that, like all protective mechanisms they are not perfect and can be overwhelmed.

" Tech entrepreneurs share the secrets behind the Scandinavian technology powerhouse that produces world-beating companies as well as security and relative equality “We call it the Bjorn Borg Effect,” says Henrik Torstensson, founder of Swedish health app Lifesum. “You suddenly have this person or company that comes along and shows the world that it can be done. Overnight, Sweden was extremely good at tennis. It was like everyone was playing it.” Sweden isn’t so great at tennis these days, Torstensson concedes, but it is second-to-none when it comes to creating innovative companies – and Spotify is the new Borg. People underestimate the magnitude of Spotify’s achievements, says Torstensson. He should know, he worked there as head of premium sales before founding Lifesum, a comprehensive weight loss and lifestyle-tracking app that boasts more than 20 million users. “Only Netflix in the entire world is adding subscribers at a faster pace than Spotify. In any type of media. They’re outperforming Apple, they’re outperforming Google, Microsoft.” Torstensson talks with an understated modesty that belies the gravity of what he’s saying. It’s a typically Swedish trait – part of a national psyche that has been injected with a huge shot of confidence thanks to multi-billion dollar firms such as Spotify, Skype and King, the developer of the insanely popular Candy Crush games. The music streaming service is the first European technology company that has taken on the biggest of the US giants at their own game and won. Apple effectively admitted as much when it set up its own rival streaming service in 2015. Spotify has done this from Stockholm, a city of less than one million people that has more unicorns – defined as privately-owned companies valued at more than $1bn – per person than any other city on the planet. The city’s phenomenal success has caught the attention of the world and rippled out across the Nordic region over the last few years. Just as everyone seemed to be playing tennis in the 1980s, now, it seems, everyone is programming – and the booming tech scene is going from strength to strength. Gothenburg, Sweden’s second city and industrial heartland, is home to a fresh breed of startups, ready to roll off the production line of the unicorn factory. Similarly, in just five years, Oslo’s startup scene has gone from non-existent to thriving, partly thanks to government investment. None of this is supposed to be here. The Nordics have some of the highest taxes, most generous welfare programmes and lowest levels of inequality in the world. The orthodox view in the UK and US dictates that to encourage innovation, the state should remove its clumsy hands from the wheels of industry, cut taxes, slash budgets and burn red tape. This will incentivise entrepreneurs to create shiny new things. The US has been incredibly successful at producing world-beating companies; a high level of inequality is the other side of this coin. It sharpens the wits and gives people the jolt they need to get out there and make something in the world. Welfare breeds “dependency” and laziness, so the argument goes. Society’s losers are a necessary by-product of the kind of all-or-nothing environment where winners win, and they win big. Wealth will trickle down.  The Nordics pose a difficult problem for peddlers of this thesis and offer a fundamentally different paradigm for success.  Coinciding with Scandinavia’s rise, something appears to be turning rotten at the heart of Silicon Valley, the world’s foremost technology and innovation powerhouse. In 2017, a pervasive sexual harassment problem has been highlighted; lack of diversity has continued to plague the scene at senior levels, and a series of other corporate scandals have marred its reputation. Meanwhile, the policies of many western governments are delivering stagnant wages and weak growth, which has helped fuel the resurgence of racially charged, right-wing identity politics – and a worrying breakdown of social cohesion. For Sam Manaberi, founder of Gothenburg-based startup Trine, Sweden’s social safety net and wealth equality are at the very heart of what makes his country so innovative. “Sweden is an awesome place to start a business and an awesome place to raise a family,” he says. Trine runs an online platform linking investors directly with solar projects in areas of Africa without access to the electricity grid. Manaberi and his co-founders developed the concept at an incubator in Gothenburg’s prestigious Chalmers University. He is just about to take the last of his 480 days paternity leave entitlement, which he has spread over the last eight years as his son has grown up. He took a summer off when he came back to his home country from the US, where he’d worked as an executive for German industrial giant Bosch. “It was a great time for reflection and hanging out with my son,” he says. “I decided there isn’t that much risk in starting a business. Maybe it had to do with the fact I’d lived in the US for several years – that’s real risk.” “Here, the worst thing that could happen was that I lost the salary I would have earned. Healthcare works really well and there are great schools. That safety net was so, so important.” Torstensson’s colleague, Victoria Bastide, at Lifesum worked in Silicon Valley for 15 years before moving back to Stockholm. “In Sweden you have more people who aren’t from a wealthy background that are daring to create startups,” she says. “In the US you’re taking a huge gamble: your kid’s college fund, your house, your health. If you lose your job you lose your health insurance.”  A growing body of evidence supports the idea that a strong safety net encourages entrepreneurialism. But this is far from the only ingredient in Nordic success. France has high taxes and generous welfare but few tech giants that many could name. Sweden is also one of the most transparent countries in the world and, consequently, one of the most trusting. For decades you have been able to look up anyone’s salary, for example. Norway has a similar system. Transparency has helped foster an atmosphere of collaboration that has been vital in building new tech companies. Nordic countries also have a strong scientific tradition going back centuries, which has been supplemented by exceptional – and free – technical education. In Sweden this has provided the impetus for world-beating companies such as Ericsson and Volvo to grow. Swedish firms invest in research and development at almost double the rate of their British counterparts, and the culture of “paying it forward” – successful founders putting money and expertise back into the startup ecosystem – is deeply ingrained. “You don’t just go to Spain and drink pina coladas,” as Torstensson puts it. Also central to the Nordic way of life is the concept of Jantelagen, or “the law of Jante” summed up in the 1933 novel,  . Its essence is a culture that emphasises the virtues of achieving things collectively and looks upon ostentation and individuality with suspicion. It’s the antithesis of the American braggadocious style of business that’s been idolised and beamed to television screens around the world through programmes like   – an ugly pageant of slicked back, fake-tanned Gordon Gekko wannabes, staring down the camera, puffing up their egos with outlandish claims of imagined success. Individualism, arrogance and an “Alpha-male” attitude are traits that frequently define what it means to be successful in the US model, which has been mimicked to some extent in the UK. These are the values behind Silicon Valley’s “tech-bro” culture; they are also a set of ideas that many argue has reached its apotheosis in Donald Trump – the President who boasts of grabbing women by the p***y. There are, as far as I can tell, no Gordon Gekkos in the Nordics. And nothing remotely resembling the Donald (if such a thing exists). Strolling along Stockholm’s equivalent of London’s Park Lane, there’s not a lime-green Lamborghini in sight. A version of   has never been made for the Swedish audience. I doubt it would go down well.  A lack of prestige and social hierarchy drives the risk-taking needed to produce successful businesses says Manaberi. “I had two really big cars in the US and a really nice house. The day after, I was living in a small flat with a bike.” “Here, all I have to do is to reconcile that with myself. I don’t have to worry about society’s pressure. Anyone who cares about it is an idiot, from a Swedish point of view. “Everybody likes to have fancy stuff but it could be equally cool to just ride a bike.” This is a nation where the next in line to the throne, Crown Princess Victoria, married her former personal trainer. And Victoria’s brother, Prince Carl Philip, wed a former glamour model who once posed for a lads’ mag wearing nothing more than a thong and a live python. Outside royal circles, Ikea founder Ingvar Kamprad is believed to be worth about $55bn (£41bn) but lives a famously frugal lifestyle, buying second-hand clothes from a flea market and living in an unassuming bungalow. Egalitarianism runs deep; the hierarchy is flat.  But the national psyche has undergone some recent changes that have been crucial to Sweden’s success, says Leandro Saucedo, chief investment officer at podcasting app Acast. “Before the last five, 10 years, failing in Sweden was not an option. The attitude was: if you’re going to start a business, do it. Don’t be too successful though. And don’t fail. Don’t fail.” “OK, Ikea rules the world today but it took 10 years before he opened his second store because he needed to be profitable first,” Saucedo says. “Historically and culturally that’s been way you build a business in Sweden.” “Now, people realise that if you want to create the next Facebook you have to switch your mindset. With that, the failure mentality has been accepted. It wasn’t when we were younger”. Many Swedes in the current crop of startups were teenagers when the dotcom bubble burst in spectacular fashion. Entrepreneurs of that period were vilified in the Swedish media, says Saucedo. “A lot of those companies obviously failed miserably but, as kids, we thought, that’s cool. Why did this go belly-up? Fast-forward 10 years and these kids have started their own businesses.” Government also played a key role in the development of today’s thriving startup scene by subsidising computers and fast internet connections. “In the 1990s, you could be a working-class kid with a computer at home even if your parents didn’t make a lot of money. By the early 2000s you could have a pretty decent broadband connection,” says Torstensson. “If you have a whole generation of kids – not just the top 10 per cent, but all of the kids – online, five or 10 years before everyone else, I believe it pays off.” Sweden is often ahead of the curve, says Saucedo. “For better or worse, we are extremely trend-sensitive,” he says, reclining in his chair, dressed in a smart blazer with purple paisley-patterned cravat and immaculate long blonde hair brushed back over his head. “If red is the colour of the month, Stockholm is red. You go to a nightclub with people from other countries and they are like, ‘People are so dressed up. Everyone is so trendy’ – but in reality, nobody is standing out,” he explains. “If everyone has an iPhone you have to have an iPhone, but you can’t have one with diamonds because that’s too much. “The only way to try to be edgy is to be on the trend earlier than someone else. Everyone is up to date and early adopters.” This makes it the perfect petri dish to test new tech ideas. When Facebook created the ‘Like’ button, they chose Sweden as the place to try it out first, says Mary Ghahremani, Acast’s manager for Sweden. Nordic tech firms also offer an ethos that Silicon Valley may have lost say Ola Sars and Joel Broms Brosjö, co-founders of Soundtrack Your Brand, which provides music streaming services to companies. “In Silicon Valley, people roll in, do their time, whatever’s needed to get their stock options, then move away to the next thing,” says Brosjö “It’s like the old gold-digger mentality.”  “You don’t build anything in a year,” Sars adds. Only a handful of staff have ever left Soundtrack Your Brand since the pair founded it in 2013, along with fellow co-founder Andreas Liffgarden. Despite not embracing the gold-digger mentality, or perhaps because of it, Nordic firms compete on a global level. And the huge success of Sweden’s tech unicorns seems to have resulted in the negative side of the Jantelagen philosophy being ditched, to some extent – the idea that if nobody should think they are special, nobody can be extraordinary. What those firms have achieved is extraordinary, and it’s been wholeheartedly embraced. It has shifted people’s perspective and “added an extra few rows to the scorecard”, says Torstensson.   Soundtrack Your Brand aims to become the dominant global player in the business-to-business music market, just as Spotify has been in the consumer world, says Sars. “We’re not shy about saying that.”  Sars gives his team of fewer than 100 people the blueprint that proves they can win against the really big guys. “The number one rule is you can’t lose focus. If you do, you will always have 100th of the funds that an American competitor will have. They go to one market and they have 350 million consumers. We have nine million,” he explains. “The starting point is always unfair but with the heritage that we have in design, music and engineering, you can do it.” We use cookies to enhance your visit to our site and to bring you advertisements that might interest you.

" In-store sales of non-food items fell by 4.4 per cent in December as squeezed shoppers spent more of their household budgets on essential items Non-food retail sales slumped in December, as shoppers hit by   reined in spending over the crucial Christmas period, research by the British Retail Consortium shows. The figures, published on Tuesday in collaboration with KPMG, show that in-store sales of non-food items dropped by 4.4 per cent on a like-for-like basis – which strips out changes in store size - in the three months to December, compared to the same period in 2016. That was the deepest since records began in 2012. However, food sales increased 2.6 per cent on a like-for-like basis, the highest since June. Like-for-like   sales – so the two categories combined – rose 0.6 per cent from December 2016, when they had risen 1 per cent from the previous year. Analysts said rising inflation and stagnant   growth meant squeezed shoppers were now having to spending a greater proportion of their budgets on essential food items. “The divergence between growth in sales of food and non-food has never been so stark,” said BRC chief executive Helen Dickinson. “With inflation outpacing income growth, shoppers continued to see more of their spending power absorbed by essential items, including food, leaving less left over for buying Christmas gifts,” she added. By contrast, overall online sales rose by 7.6 per cent, but this was still below the 12-month average of 8.0 per cent. Paul Martin, head of retail at KPMG, said the figures further reinforced the disparity between the high street and online. “Whilst a proportion of this divide can be attributed to Cyber Monday, shoppers are increasingly preferring to shop online, especially at Christmas,” he said. “Grocers benefitted from festive feasts, but growth elsewhere on the high street was otherwise rather muted for the time of year. In contrast, all online categories grew, with health and beauty, shoes and clothes proving particularly popular. This all comes ahead of customer returns of course, but nevertheless December’s cold weather appeared to contribute to a fashion frenzy,” he added.

" Elderly people consuming one portion of vegetables per day had brains effectively 11 years younger than those who did not, according to new research Eating plenty of   every day could ward off  in later life, new research suggests. A study of elderly people found those who ate around one serving of leafy greens each day had brains that were the equivalent of 11 years younger than those who never or rarely ate the vegetables. A serving equalled about 100g of cooked spinach, kale or collard greens such as cabbage or sprouts, or about 200g of lettuce salad. Those who performed the best in memory and intelligence tests ate an average of about 1.3 servings per day. Dr Martha Morris, of Rush University Medical Centre in Chicago, led the study published in the journal  . She said: “Adding a daily serving of green, leafy vegetables to your diet may be a simple way to foster your brain health. “Projections show sharp increases in the percentage of people with dementia as the oldest age groups continue to grow in number, so effective strategies to prevent dementia are critical.” Her team analysed the eating habits of 960 people, with an average age of 81, who did not have dementia and tracked them for an average of 4.7 years. After annual tests on their thinking and memory skills, the researchers split them into five groups based on how often they ate green, leafy vegetables. Those in the top serving group ate an average of about 1.3 servings per day, while those in the lowest serving group ate on average 0.1 servings per day. Overall their performance on the thinking and memory tests declined over time at a rate of 0.08 standardised units per year. Over a 10-year period the rate of decline for those who ate the most leafy greens was slower by 0.05 standardised units per year than the rate for those who ate the least leafy greens. The scientists said this was equivalent to being 11 years younger in age.

 PA Dr Morris noted that while the study showed an association between eating leafy green vegetables and better brain function, it did not prove that eating lots of spinach, kale and other greens is the direct cause. However the results remained valid after the scientists accounted for other factors that are bad for brain health, such as smoking, obesity and how often they did physical and mental activities. The age of the test group, who were mostly white, means the results may not apply to younger adults and people from different ethnic groups, Dr Morris said.

 PA Eighty per cent of new homes on NHS land in the UK are up for market sale. On a nurse’s salary the mortgage payments would be unaffordable on four out of five properties being sold, assuming nurses should spend 45 per cent of their income or less on housing. The average cost of the houses for sale on NHS sites was £315,279.  This is 10 times the salary of midwives and nurses, 12 times a paramedic salary and 17 times that of clinical support staff, according to the report. In the capital the average cost will be £561,589, which the NEF said would require a nurse to save for 117 years just to afford a 20 per cent deposit. It has also highlighted how some developers were able to sidestep requirements to build affordable homes by haggling or using “loopholes” in the planning system. This includes development on the former site of Bucknall hospital in Stoke-on-Trent, where developer Keep Moat are building 201 houses, “not one of which would be classed as affordable”. The developer negotiated a “meagre contribution” to the council, of £209,000 for cheaper homes to be built elsewhere, according to the NEF. Yorkshire property developer Persimmon Homes – whose chairman   in excess of £110m – also benefited. Its development on the site of former Pontefract General Infirmary was required by Wakefield Council to ensure 30 per cent of the homes were affordable. The NEF report says Persimmon later said the requirement would lead to “financial inviability” and negotiated the requirement down to six per cent – seven out of the 124 homes being built. Persimmon made pre-tax profits of £775m in 2016, largely on developments subsidised by the Government’s Help to Buy scheme. The NEF report argued that instead of selling land piecemeal to private developers, the Government should instead set up a public “land bank” with land earmarked exclusively for millions of affordable houses. “Across this Parliament alone, using only public land, the Government could build 320,000 genuinely affordable homes in partnership with communities, local authorities and housing associations,” it said. Joe Beswick, housing lead at the New Economics Foundation, said: “These local NHS sites are community assets – they should be used to deliver community benefits. “Public land – which is owned by all of us – is being flogged off to developers so that they can make massive profits, while producing a tiny amount of affordable housing. “The UK is facing an enormous housing crisis, and the Government is making it worse.”  Gerry O’Dwyer, senior employment relations advisor at the Royal College of Nursing, told  : “It’s obviously of great concern that so much NHS land is being sold off to private developers, with the resulting accommodation priced way beyond the salary of the average nurse.” He said a land bank was an “interesting idea”, but added: “If nursing staff were paid fair wages for the extremely demanding work they do, they would be able to get on the housing ladder more quickly.” The Department of Health was approached for comment but did not respond by time of publication We use cookies to enhance your visit to our site and to bring you advertisements that might interest you.

" Risks increases by about 3.3 per cent 'for every five years spent doing regular night shift work' Women who work night shifts are 20 per cent more likely to develop some form of cancer, with nurses being particularly at risk, according to new research. Breaking down risk by length of time spent working nights, researchers in   predicted that risks increased by about 3.3 per cent “for every five years spent doing regular night shift work”. They came to the conclusion after analysing 61 studies which examined a link between long-term night shifts and 11 different cancers.   Overall they found that women who worked nights were 20 per cent more likely to have a diagnosis at some point. “Given the expanding prevalence of shift work worldwide and the heavy public burden of cancers, we initiated this study to draw public attention to this issue,” said lead author, Dr Xueliei Ma, an Oncologist at West China Medical Center of Sichuan University. Researchers found that the night-shift workers were 41 per cent more likely to have skin cancers and 32 per cent more likely to have breast cancer. However, the increased risk of breast cancer was only seen in European and North American populations. The study, published in the journal  , also analysed staff by occupation and found nurses who worked nightshifts had the highest increases in cancer risk of any occupational group. Stopping smoking.

Processed foods in developed countries appear to be causing higher rates of colon cancer than diets in continents such as Africa, which have high bean and pulse intakes  Two servings of fruit and three servings of vegetables a day were given as the magic number for good diet in the research. Overall, diet causes only slightly fewer cancer deaths than sun exposure in Australia, at 7,000 a year Obesity and being overweight, linked to poor diet and lack of exercise, causes 3,917 deaths by cancer a year on its own  Dying of a cancer caused by infection also comes in highly, linked to 3,421 cancer deaths a year. Infections such as human papilloma virus - which can cause cervical cancer in women - and hepatitis - can be prevented by vaccinations and having regular check-ups Cutting back on drinks could reduce the risk of cancers caused by alcohol - such as liver cancer, bowel cancer, breast cancer and mouth cancer - that are leading to 3,208 deaths a year 2014  Sitting around and not getting the heart pumping - less than one hour's exercise a day - is directly leading to about 1,800 people having lower immune functions and higher hormone levels, among other factors, that cause cancers 2011  Hormone replacement therapy, which is used to relieve symptoms of the menopause in women, caused 539 deaths from (mainly breast) cancer in Australia last year.

They also have less healthy eating and lifestyle habits, like smoking, which are major risk factors for cancer and a range of other diseases. But studies have also shown that the disruption night-shifts cause to sleep patterns has an impact that’s seen at a genetic level, and can through biological processes into “chaos”. ​There are around   and Dr Ma says employers should take steps to offer their staff more regular health checks to mitigate these risks. Nearly four million women from North America, Europe, Australia, and Asia took part in the studies evaluated by Dr Ma, and there were 114,000 individual cancer cases reported in this group. Dr Ma speculated this could be because those working in medical roles are more aware of cancer screening programmes and so these are more likely to be picked up. “Another possible explanation for the increased cancer risk in this population may relate to the job requirements of night shift nursing, such as more intensive shifts,” Dr Ma said. Our study indicates that night shift work serves as a risk factor for common cancers in women. She added: “These results might help establish and implement effective measures to protect female night shifters. Long-term night shift workers should have regular physical examinations and cancer screenings.

" Aged 16, and suffering from Crohn's disease, Laura Lartey found herself homeless. She still kept studying for her GCSEs, even when her only shelter was a night bus Even now, the trauma still resurfaces whenever she is told off by those with any sort of power over her. It takes Laura Lartey back to the nights when she was 16, cold, lonely and too frightened to sleep as she took shelter surrounded by drunks on a night bus, because she had  . It takes her back to the moments she always dreaded, when the driver spotted her, questioned her – “so many questions, ‘Where are you going’? ‘Why are you on this bus’?” – and asked her to leave. “I would be saying ‘ , I’m sorry’,” she says. “But they don’t listen. They don’t get it.” Now 20, with the presence of a performer who was taking dance and theatre classes aged three and appearing in shows at Disneyland Paris aged 11, she can at least muster some finely tuned mockery of such attitudes. “Of course I am a drug addict,” she says, the wry grin softening the scorn. “Of course I am pregnant. Of course I am an alcoholic. Clearly I am on the streets doing nothing with my life.  “Actually, so many young people who are homeless are in university, in college, working 24-7.” “Not having a roof over your head does not mean you are worthless,” she says. “It doesn’t mean you are doing nothing with your life. It just means  .” Unbeknown to those who didn’t want her on the night bus or who denied her shelter in 24-hour fast food restaurants (“because they think you smell and will cause trouble”), this homeless 16-year-old was still “doing my school, trying to live my life”. In fact, sometimes she would go from the night bus to sitting a GCSE exam. The breakdown in relations with her parents that led to her leaving the middle-class family home in north-west London came in the summer of 2012, during exam season. The fracture in family relations led to two years of sofa-surfing “North, south, east west,” says Laura. “I ended up carrying my bags all round London, staying with friends, second cousins, in 20 to 25 addresses.” And when there were gaps in the sofa surfing, when she felt uncomfortable about overstaying her welcome, or when friends could no longer accommodate her because the flat was too full or they risked having their housing benefit stopped, she would resort to the night buses. Relationship breakdown, usually between young people and their parents or step-parents, is a major cause of youth homelessness. Around six in ten young people who come to Centrepoint say they had to leave home because of arguments, relationship breakdown or being told to leave. Many have experienced long-term problems at home, often involving violence, leaving them without the family support networks that most of us take for granted Young people who come to Centrepoint face a range of different and complex problems. More than a third have a mental health issue, such as depression and anxiety, another third need to tackle issues with substance misuse. A similar proportion also need to improve their physical health. These problems often overlap, making it more difficult for young people to access help and increasing the chances of them becoming homeless /iStockphoto Young people's chances of having to leave home are higher in areas of high deprivation and poor prospects for employment and education. Many of those who experience long spells of poverty can get into problem debt, which makes it harder for them to access housing /iStockphoto Homeless young people are often affected by gang-related problems. In some cases, it becomes too dangerous to stay in their local area meaning they can end up homeless. One in six young people at Centrepoint have been involved in or affected by gang crime /iStockphoto Not being in education can make it much more difficult for young people to access help with problems at home or health problems. Missing out on formal education can also make it more difficult for them to move into work /iStockphoto Almost a quarter of young people at Centrepoint have been in care. They often have little choice but to deal with the challenges and responsibilities of living independently at a young age. Traumas faced in their early lives make care leavers some of the most vulnerable young people in our communities, with higher chances of poor outcomes in education, employment and housing. Their additional needs mean they require a higher level of support to maintain their accommodation /iStockphoto Around 13 per cent of young people at Centrepoint are refugees or have leave to remain, meaning it isn't safe to return home. This includes young people who come to the UK as unaccompanied minors, fleeing violence or persecution in their own country. After being granted asylum, young people sometimes find themselves with nowhere to go and can end up homeless /iStockphoto Laura, a member of what some insist on calling “the snowflake generation”, describes the routine. “I normally took the 171 from central London to the far south-east, or the 221, because they were the longer routes. I had a Zip Oyster Card so it was free. “I would try to hide upstairs, and stay on as the bus went back and forth from one end of its route to the other, until the driver found me.” She rarely got any sleep. “I was constantly cold. I was sitting there thinking ‘Oh my gosh, someone is going to rob me’. So I would try to stay awake and keep hold of my stuff, wrap my coat and my bags around me. “But at the same time you have to try to make it look like you are not homeless, so the people on the buses don’t kick you off.” And then, after a restless night, she would get to school early, put her coat and bags in a locker, and take a GCSE exam. Revision, she says, would be done in libraries with late opening hours. “I did my coursework in school. I stayed late and gave it back that day. I had nowhere to go to.” Hard enough, you might think, but throughout this time Laura was also struggling with  , an inflammation of the digestive system that can cause diarrhoea, stomach pain and exhaustion. Sofa surfing interspersed by stays on night buses was, she admits, the worst possible thing for her illness. “Not getting enough sleep will irritate it. Stress, anxiety and a lack of stability are even worse. “It was horrible. I got really, really skinny. I couldn’t eat because of blisters on my mouth caused by my Crohn’s disease. I had to keep looking for bathrooms. No one would let me use the toilet. People thought I was drunk. It was the stigma of homelessness.” And yet she got her grades, 10 GCSEs at A* to C: “English, maths, RE, PE, drama, dance…”  There were three A*s. A B-Tech in musical theatre and business studies followed, while she was sofa-surfing.  And again, “I got my grades”. She shrugs. No big deal, apparently. “Because of my illness, exhaustion is just my day. It’s just my life.   “And it wasn’t that bad, because around my area the bus and train stations are 24 hours, so you can stay there.”   Like many who might be helped by the   being campaigned for by  and the charity  , it was a long, long time before Laura had skilled professionals to assist her. She never told her school or college she was homeless.   “I guess I thought it was my fault for falling out with my parents. I blamed myself for a while.” Only when she was desperate, when all the sofa-surfing options had dried up and “I had literally nowhere to go”, did she seek help.   She stayed in a Centrepoint hostel for four months. With the help and encouragement of the charity’s staff, she achieved a reconciliation with her parents.  Laura is in housing association accommodation now. The B-Tech, and those A*s in drama and dance are being put to good use. Laura has started Hear The Motion, her own performing arts company, aimed at enriching the lives and boosting the confidence of young people. She does dance workshops, drama workshops, she says.  And another subject, one in which, you might think, she is also well qualified: “Anything to do with self-motivation.” We use cookies to enhance your visit to our site and to bring you advertisements that might interest you.

" Levelle London supported US R&B star Mario while homeless and ‘living out of a bag’ Up-and-coming singer Levelle London, who along with several other artists sings on the   campaign’s charity release “Helpline Ring”, has revealed his own battle with homelessness. “It started when I was 15,” he said, “I had problems at home, moving in and out of my mum’s house in north London, sometimes in with my dad in south London, and sometimes with friends, sofa-surfing.” At the time, the council required parental authorisation for under-18s seeking re-housing. His mum refused to write the letter. “I started   aged 16,” said London. “I was living out of a bag, going from house to house, and that's when I started making music. My situation was so harsh, I just started writing these raw, honest songs.” At school London dreamed of being a   MC, but gravitated to a more mellow,  sound as he got older.   Even with no fixed address, he continued to record music and play shows, including as a support act for American R&B star, Mario. “It was strange. I was supporting a big star, and I was standing on stage thinking, I don't know where I'm staying tonight. It was a bittersweet time.” “Helpline Ring”, a cover of  , is to be released online next week. The song aims to raise awareness for the  , the first multi-channel advice service specifically for young people at risk of homelessness.  “I wish I had something like this when I became homeless,” said London.  Eventually London approached Alone in London, a service for 16-25-year olds at risk of homelessness, who set him up with a room in Hackney for a year. He now lives at Peter Bedford Housing Association in Hackney, where he is finding time to concentrate on his music.  “Not every song is about homelessness or depression but I always make sure I keep talking about those things because music is my counselling, my diary.”  Relationship breakdown, usually between young people and their parents or step-parents, is a major cause of youth homelessness. Around six in ten young people who come to Centrepoint say they had to leave home because of arguments, relationship breakdown or being told to leave. Many have experienced long-term problems at home, often involving violence, leaving them without the family support networks that most of us take for granted Young people who come to Centrepoint face a range of different and complex problems. More than a third have a mental health issue, such as depression and anxiety, another third need to tackle issues with substance misuse. A similar proportion also need to improve their physical health. These problems often overlap, making it more difficult for young people to access help and increasing the chances of them becoming homeless /iStockphoto Young people's chances of having to leave home are higher in areas of high deprivation and poor prospects for employment and education. Many of those who experience long spells of poverty can get into problem debt, which makes it harder for them to access housing /iStockphoto Homeless young people are often affected by gang-related problems. In some cases, it becomes too dangerous to stay in their local area meaning they can end up homeless. One in six young people at Centrepoint have been involved in or affected by gang crime /iStockphoto Not being in education can make it much more difficult for young people to access help with problems at home or health problems. Missing out on formal education can also make it more difficult for them to move into work /iStockphoto Almost a quarter of young people at Centrepoint have been in care. They often have little choice but to deal with the challenges and responsibilities of living independently at a young age. Traumas faced in their early lives make care leavers some of the most vulnerable young people in our communities, with higher chances of poor outcomes in education, employment and housing. Their additional needs mean they require a higher level of support to maintain their accommodation /iStockphoto Around 13 per cent of young people at Centrepoint are refugees or have leave to remain, meaning it isn't safe to return home. This includes young people who come to the UK as unaccompanied minors, fleeing violence or persecution in their own country. After being granted asylum, young people sometimes find themselves with nowhere to go and can end up homeless /iStockphoto As a teenager, London and his best friend promised each other they would make it.  He said: “We were in a science lesson and my friend said to me, ‘one day, we're both going to be on the red carpet’.” His friend kept his promise:  , star of   and  , is now a bankable Hollywood star.  Boyega invited London along to the London premier. “We were at the Star Wars premier and I said to him, John, we did it, we’re on the red carpet,” he said. “Now it’s my turn to take him to the red carpet. I’ve just got to put the work in.” We use cookies to enhance your visit to our site and to bring you advertisements that might interest you. Read our   and   Policies to find out more.

" Veteran presenter says nearly three-minute slot is inappropriate in increasingly secular society  has described the Thought for the Day slot on   Radio 4's  programme as deeply, deeply boring. Humphrys, the most senior presenter on the programme, said the nearly three-minute slot, which begins at 7.45am, was inappropriate in a society which is becoming increasingly secular.  Asked what he thought of Thought of the Day in  , the 74-year-old said: “Deeply, deeply boring, often.

" To many who believe the US took a turn for the worse in 2017 the killing of Heather Heyer marks a dark moment in its history – it was reported last week that neo-Nazis are still on the hunt for her ashes, while the man suspected of killing her is on trial. But Heyer’s life was ‘magnified’ in death, as her mother put it. Its brightness dazzles In Heather Heyer’s last Facebook post, she warned her friends, “If you’re not outraged, you’re not paying attention.” Heyer, who died aged 32 in August, always paid attention. Her family recalls her as someone who was quick to spot injustice and call it out, even as a child. She was the only daughter of Susan Bro and Mark Heyer, a little sister to brother Nickolas. Her mother had hoped that Heyer’s birth would patch up her failing marriage, but sadly it didn’t work.  Heyer’s parents separated when she was just five months old. And there were health problems to be overcome too. Heyer was born with her left ear folded over and underwent several corrective surgeries. She grew up in Ruckersville, Virginia, a rural town with an overwhelmingly white population. She attended the William Monroe High School where, by her mother’s admission, she wasn’t the most diligent student. She was a late sleeper, and talked of wanting to be like a “fat cat on a pillow and not have to do anything”, but the tributes that poured in after her death proved that wasn’t the whole story.  Heyer would never sit back when she could stand up to a bully, even rushing to the defence of a teacher abused for adopting an Asian child.  On leaving school, she found work in a restaurant. She was good at her job and popular, sometimes making $200 in tips on a weekend. But she wanted more. A friend encouraged her to apply for a job as a legal assistant at Miller Law. At the interview, she admitted she worried she might not be a suitable candidate. “I only have a high-school degree, and I’ve never worked in a law office,’ she said. “Why is that important to you? It’s not important to me,” responded interviewer Alfred A Wilson, who would become her boss and mentor. He saw at once that Heyer was a “people person” and her warmth would be a great asset to Miller Law. Heyer’s job was to liaise with the firm’s clients, many of whom were facing eviction, and help them feel less daunted by the paperwork their cases required. Though her clients were often at their lowest ebb, Heyer made them feel valued and hopeful. A gay black client told Wilson that Heyer “treated me as if I was the richest man ...  I was about to lose my home, but she just saw Mr Smith.” Though she juggled her job at Miller Law with more waitressing shifts at local restaurant Caturra on the Corner, Heyer found time to take night classes to improve her knowledge of law and her ability to help those in need. The summer of 2017 marked Heyer’s fifth year with the company. To celebrate the occasion, Wilson took her out for lunch and presented her with a certificate recognising her outstanding service. Though she treated everyone she met as an equal, Heyer was increasingly aware that Miller, an African American, didn’t always have the respect of his white clients. For example, she noticed and was distressed when people wouldn’t shake his hand. Such examples of prejudice would bring Heyer to tears. She was horrified by the election of Donald Trump, and when she heard that far-right activists were planning a protest in Charlottesville over the decision to remove a statue of Confederate General Robert E Lee, Heyer knew she should not stand by. All the same, according to her close friend Justin Marks, Heyer was not sure she would attend the counter-protest. The public was being warned to stay away. Her mind was changed when the night before the Unite The Right rally, she saw footage of white nationalists storming the University of Virginia buildings carrying tiki torches. She knew then that she had to make a stand for everything she believed.  According to witnesses, Heyer was on her way home from the counter-protest when she was knocked down as a Nazi fanatic from Ohio ploughed into the crowd in his Dodge Challenger. 35 people were injured that day. Heyer was killed. Her friend Felicia Correa said of Heyer, “She died doing what was right.” Purple was Heyer’s favourite colour. Even her beloved chocolate Chihuahua was called Violet. Mourners at her funeral were invited to dress accordingly. Her mother, Susan Bro, gave a stirring speech in which she said, “They tried to kill my child to shut her up. Well, guess what? You just magnified her.” Since then, Susan Bro has set up the Heather Heyer Foundation in her daughter’s memory, funding scholarships for trainee paralegals and social workers. The city of Charlottesville has moved to rename its Fourth Street in Heyer’s honour. But while Heyer’s family and friends wait for the outcome of her suspected murderer’s trial, Heyer’s final resting place is unmarked to avoid vandalism and the potential of violence towards the people who tend it. “It’s a symptom of hate in society that you should have to protect your child’s grave,” said Bro. Bro still receives abuse and death threats from white supremacists. She treads carefully around the subject of President Trump out of fear for the safety of her son, an army reservist. When asked who he thought had killed Heather Heyer, her boss Wilson of Miller Law said, “I would say our society killed her.” We use cookies to enhance your visit to our site and to bring you advertisements that might interest you.

" He cut his political teeth against the demise of the mining industry in Scotland, opposed independence in favour of working-class unity and voted against the Iraq war Jimmy Hood was a Scottish Labour politician who opposed independence for Scotland in favour of working-class unity. “If the Scottish people are to be better off economically,” he said, “I’d still be against Scottish independence, and I’d still vote no.” Hood represented Clydesdale in Parliament from 1987 to 2015. He was also an official of the National Union of Mineworkers during the miners’ strike of 1984-85. The former MP, who lost his seat to the SNP sweep in 2015, who has died aged 69, was Born in Lesmahagow, Lanarkshire. His mother was a mill worker and his father a miner.  While attending Motherwell technical college he got a job at the Auchlochan colliery. In 1967 he married Marion McCleary, who survives him along with their children Bill and Helen.  The mining industry in that part of Scotland was being destroyed, so Hood uprooted his wife and young son to seek employment in the mines of the Nottinghamshire coalfield. In his maiden speech in Westminster, he said: “I was one of the original industrial gypsies, and I now stand elected as member of Parliament for Clydesdale, where I was born and bred. I liken this experience to the salmon coming back home from the sea to the fresh water.” He found a ready job at the Ollerton pit as a coalface engineer. Joining the Labour Party in 1970, Hood was elected to Ollerton Parish Council in 1973 and to the Newark and Sherwood District Council in 1979. From this position he was one of the leaders of the NUM strike in Nottinghamshire that supported Arthur Scargill. He became involved in epic battles with the Union of Democratic Miners in Nottinghamshire in 1984 and 1985.  It was widely felt that the refusal to strike of the majority of those who worked in the highly productive Nottinghamshire pits led to the failure of the NUM’s action. Hood told me that he put his name forward for the Clydesdale seat when it became clear that Dame Judith Hart would not stand again, partly because he could not face a lifetime of bitterness and strife in Nottinghamshire between those who had supported the strike and those who had defied Scargill (about whom Hood had increasing reservations).  In 1987 he won the seat with a majority of 10,502 over a Conservative rival’s 11,324. With only 45 per cent of the vote, Hood became quickly aware that extreme politics would not produce the Labour government which, as a constructive trade unionist, he craved.  I vividly remember his maiden speech on a hot July evening in 1987: He said: “I am well aware of the traditions of this House that new members are expected to be nice and uncontroversial, to say nice and pleasant things, to sit down and then to descend to the tea rooms or the bars for a well-earned pat on the back from one’s peers.  “I shall at all times, where possible, respect this place and its traditions, but honesty with oneself is a prerequisite to honour, and no honourable member representing working-class people can, after eight years of Mrs Thatcher’s government, come to this place from a Scottish constituency such as Clydesdale, listen to the Queen’s Speech, knowing the further misery that this government intends to inflict on the working-class people of my constituency and not be controversial.” Hood was indeed to be controversial but because he was never ill-mannered and because he respected his opponents, he became very well-liked by both colleagues and opponents. He was a cause politician and presented, usually under the 10-minute rule bill, a series of worthwhile measures that were later encapsulated in government legislation.  For example, in 1991 he brought in a bill to make illegal the consumption of alcohol by under-18s prohibit its consumption in designated areas. He told the Commons that he first became aware of the problem through his surgery work when an elderly woman came to see him and said that she was frightened to go out of her home after 6pm as gangs of drunken youths were terrorising her little housing estate and pensioners were prisoners in their own homes. “I am not just talking about the sly pint of beer or half pint of lager that is drunk in the backroom of a pub or disco by 16- and 17-year-olds,” he said. “Rather, I am talking about the 12- to 13-year-old girls and boys who become hooked on hard booze and stalk the streets at night getting involved in petty social misbehaviour and progressing to serious alcohol-dependent problems that inevitably lead to serious crimes.” Hood recounted how a constituent had come to see him about her 16-year-old son who had been a high achiever at school and was set for university. He had become trapped in a web of alcohol abuse, dropped out of school and got into trouble with the police. He then faced the serious consequences of missing out on education and of the legacy of a criminal record – a life wasted, all because of alcohol abuse at a young and tender age.  Another issue on which Hood’s constant campaigning in and out of Parliament made a difference was society’s attitude to ME. He introduced the first ME bill to chart the progress of the disease. Hood’s sustained interest – he didn’t just take up causes on the heels of a headline and then drop them – altered the public perception of ME sufferers.  A third cause was that of school-transport safety. In 1995 he campaigned, after a terrible accident in his constituency, for the imposing of stricter standards on school vehicles and provision for the licensing by local authorities of school vehicles and their drivers.  However, Hood’s most lasting contribution to public life will be his membership over 16 years and chairmanship of the Select Committee on European Legislation. He was naturally shrewd and extremely intelligent, and successive members told me that Hood had a balance of tolerance and expeditiousness, the same qualities that made him a highly successful member of the Speaker’s Panel of Chairmen, those who chair government bills as they go through the house. In my 40 years’ experience, he was one of the very best chairmen of the Scottish Group of Labour MPs.  He was enormously widely travelled, and his personality was a credit to Britain abroad. I often wished that he had had charge of foreign policy, since I believe that Britain’s position would have been the stronger if run by someone of Jimmy Hood’s caring international outlook. He was of the build, and not only physically, of Ernest Bevin. We use cookies to enhance your visit to our site and to bring you advertisements that might interest you.

" Copycats could and did attempt to replicate his magic shows but few if any would dare to open wide and turn the sharp end of a sword towards their throat Johnny Fox was professional sword-swallower and magician who entertained audiences across the America to help them, as he said, “forget about the sadness and the madness” in the world. Fox was by his own count one of around only 20 sword swallowers working in the US – dedicated performers who travel from festival to carnival preserving the traditions of the circus sideshows. He did coin-tricks as well as comedy and was known, according to the organisers of the local Maryland Renaissance festival – where he’d worked for 37 years – to “drive an eight inch spike into his nose” and to swallow five-foot balloons. (Renaissance happen all over the States and recreate Elizabethan England with costumes, jousting and the like.) The 64-year-old had practiced fire-swallowing until he learned it was detrimental to his health – he died from cancer. But his calling card was his sword act, which he taught himself for job security when he was in his twenties. Copycats could and did attempt to replicate his magic shows but few if any would dare to open wide and turn the sharp end of a sword in the direction of their throat. Thousands if not millions saw his act on prime time television shows hosted by the likes of David Letterman. Thousands more watched him perform at Renaissance festivals and other gatherings. He said the most important trait of a sword swallower was the ability to conquer fear – and that’s not to mention the gag-reflex. “You have to surrender and open up,” Fox told the   in 1999. The trick, he continued, is “the ability to relax and dilate your throat, the pharynx and the epiglottis … when we swallow, they both open.” To counter suspicions that he was using a retractable blade, he sometimes employed a glowing sword that made light emanate from his throat. He was said to swallow swords up to 22 inches long, and up to 16 swords at a time. In another feat, he swallowed a screwdriver. “Twist it around a couple of times so my butt doesn’t fall off,” he told NPR in October, “and make sure I do it clockwise, not counter-clockwise,” Fox was born in Minneapolis in the early fifties. An uncle of his entertained family members by inserting needles into his thumb, the Times reported. Fox grew up in Connecticut, where he was living when his father took him to the Eastern States Exposition, a New England fair where he saw curiosities including “The Giant From Reykjavik, Iceland, 8-foot-8”, “The Lobster Boy, Alive”, and The Monkey Girl, Alive”. Such so-called freaks, he told one local newspaper, were his superheroes because they had “the courage to stand in front of the public, hearing people say nasty things.” The fair also provided his introduction to sword swallowing. He recalled his brother’s incredulity: “Don’t believe it, it’s fake.” Fox’s father encouraged his boyhood interest in magic, giving him a book about Harry Houdini. Fox began his performing career in Florida but gradually became known around the country. He once appeared in a television commercial that required him to munching on light bulbs. In New York City, he operated a museum: The Freakatorium, El Museo Loco, that featured such items as a narwhale tusk, a two-headed turtle, conjoined piglets preserved through pickling, and relics billed as clothing having belonged to Tom Thumb; and entertainer Sammy Davis Jr’s glass eye.

" She was part of a pioneering band of women who were not allowed on sorties but crisscrossed the country delivering planes to the RAF “We’re honoured today to be joined by one of the very few female pilots of the Second World War, among the aircraft she flew were Spitfires and Hurricanes,” Sue Barker announced at the All England Club last year. “Centre Court please show your appreciation for Joy Lofthouse.” The crowd at Wimbledon, which included David Beckham, burst into a prolonged ovation as a diminutive, smiling figure, stood up.  Lofthouse, who has died aged 94, was a Spitfire Woman – one of the last two survivors of the band of 168 female pilots who fought against all odds in the Second World War. They were part of the Air Transport Auxiliary – hence the nickname “Attagirls” – which transported aircraft to the frontline RAF from factories and depots. In the summer of 1943, Lofthouse, too young to gain even a driving licence before the war, responded to an advertisement in   magazine from the ATA, encouraging more women to apply for training. She applied. Unbeknown to the 20-year-old, her older sister, Yvonne, already a widow, had also applied, but under her married name, which meant the authorities had no idea that they were sisters. Extraordinarily, both sisters were among the 17 selected from a field of 2,000 applicants. Having completed her training, she remained at Thame to ferry light aircraft, such as the Tiger Moth and Magister trainer, from factories to RAF flying schools. A few months later, she joined the all-female ferry pool at Hamble near Southampton, close to various aircraft manufacturers, including the Supermarine factory where the Spitfires were constructed. “You’d walk into the operations room, the hatch would open and the ops office would hand out the chits for what you’d be delivering,” Lofthouse recalled. “Sometimes we were taken to the factory at Eastleigh to collect a Spitfire. We’d transport planes to the maintenance unit where the radio and guns were fitted, but we weren’t trained to use those things.” Their schedule involved ferrying aircraft on 12-13 day cycles before a few days’ leave. “We did every kind of ferrying that was non-operational to save the air force,” she said. On one occasion, however, Lofthouse narrowly escaped disaster. Having collected a new Spitfire, with a more powerful engine, from the factory, she took off. Despite following her training, she found herself heading towards some barrage balloons at a terrifying speed. “It felt like minutes of sheer terror,” she said. “In fact it was a matter of seconds.” The aircraft straightened up, “but for that minute or two my brain was racing… am I going to hit that cable? Or whizz through it?” In all, during her two years, she flew 18 different types of aircraft, the majority single-engine, including British Hurricanes, Tempests, Typhoons and Barracudas, and the American-built P-51 Mustangs and Hellcats, but the “wonderful” Spitfire was her favourite. “Small cockpit. Very manoeuvrable – the slightest touch on the stick and she moved. It’s the nearest thing to having wings of your own and flying,” she said in 2015. Lofthouse delivered naval fighters to airfields in Scotland and during the build-up to D-Day was busy taking fighter planes, including over 50 Spitfires, to squadrons on the south coast. By the end of the war, she had converted to flying light twin-engine aircraft, with female pilots also flying to mainland Europe. “There wasn’t much to flying a new plane,” she explained. “I guess it’s the equivalent of stepping into a car you haven’t driven before. It’s not all that different.” Remarkably, the ATA girls received the same pay as their male counterparts. Over the course of the war, it delivered 309,000 aircraft of 147 different types, ranging from light training aircraft to heavy four-engine bombers. Pilots flew each type after a short briefing using a basic checklist. Although the ATA pilots did not fly combat missions, flying without radio or instrument guidance, relying solely on maps, railway lines and other local features to find their way, the weather tended to be their worst enemy with 156 losing their lives, 20 of whom were women. Born on Valentine’s Day 1923 in Cirencester, Gloucestershire, Joy Gough was the younger of two sisters. Her mother was a dressmaker while her father was a hairdresser and professional footballer, “back when they were not paid £500,000 a week”. Spurred on by their father, she and her sister Yvonne enjoyed a variety of sports, particularly tennis. Yvonne had only been married for a year to Tom Wheatley, an RAF bomber pilot, when he was killed in a bombing raid over Berlin in 1943. Growing up in Cirencester the sisters met many young pilots due to the town’s proximity to a number of airfields. Consequently, they became interested in aircraft. Lofthouse admitted, “You couldn’t just stand there, useless, dumb, when the boys were talking about planes.” Educated at Cirencester Grammar School, Lofthouse left school to work as a cashier at the local Lloyds Bank until she joined the ATA. Post-war Lofthouse worked as a teacher and brought up her family but always remained in contact with her former ATA colleagues. In 1990, she was invited with seven survivors to the RAF’s Officer and Aircrew Selection Centre at Biggin Hill, to meet the first female candidates aspiring to become RAF pilots. She later wrote to the Commandant, “Our visit brought back many happy memories – we were all made to feel young again for a short while.” In 2008, Lofthouse and the surviving Attagirls received a commemorative badge from Gordon Brown’s Labour government. “For 60 years nobody asked me about my wartime job, but for the past 10 I’ve dined out on it,” she joked. In 2015, to commemorate the 70th anniversary of VE Day, Lofthouse, then aged 92, took to the air in a Spitfire for the first time since the war as a passenger for the BBC documentary  . Flying in a dual control version of the fighter she professed to “not being as confident as I was when I used to fly them alone”. After the flight she beamed, “It was lovely. It was perfect but terribly noisy, with radio communications on all the time.” She married Czech fighter pilot Jiri Hartman, whom she met in a bank in 1945. They divorced in 1966. In 1971, she married Squadron Leader Charles Lofthouse, a decorated former Lancaster bomber pilot, whom she had met while taking a teacher training course in Portsmouth. Lofthouse later confessed that she was disappointed when the war ended because it meant that her services were no longer required. “I was very wicked,” she told an interviewer. “I never wanted [the war] to end. I was enjoying my work so much.” She is survived by her son, Peter, and daughter, Lyn, from her first marriage.

" The style guru wrote for one of Uganda’s leading English-language newspapers and trained her wit against a culture of images that caricatured women’s bodies “Fashion is a passion I was born with,” claimed the Ugandan newspaper fashion editor Keturah Kamugasa, who has died aged 50. Even as a child, Kamugasa had an eye for colour and fabric. She credited her fashion sense to her parents, whom she said knew the importance of image. Her father took her to have her hair styled every morning. Her dolls were the best dressed in town.  As a young adult, Kamugasa left Uganda for the UK, where she attended Bible college and later gained a degree in sociology from Leicester University. On her return to Africa in the mid-Nineties, Kamugasa began work as a freelance writer for  , a leading English-language newspaper in Uganda.  She quickly became a staff writer, specialising in education, health and gender issues though fashion remained her area of special interest. She was  ’s first education editor and later headed its Sunday magazine  . Kamugasa was also a pioneer in Uganda’s wedding industry.  She launched Uganda’s first wedding magazine,  , and in 2006 she inaugurated the country’s first wedding expo. At the same time, she continued to write a column for  . “Style with Keturah Kamugasa” celebrated all Uganda’s women, including new mothers, plus-size women and professional women dressing to stand out in a sea of corporate grey.  Her writing was always warm if occasionally waspish. In 2016, Kasugama wrote, “As we celebrate Women’s Day today, let us spare a thought for parts of the female anatomy that are not yet emancipated (ahem!). Apparently, the breast and her nipple are among those parts.” She added: “And so we are bombarded with pictures of buttock like cleavages; some tantalising and others downright ugly. We are expected to follow suit in the spirit of sisterhood. In any case, how empowering of women is breast exposure? In Uganda, most of us see breasts on a daily basis, whether we like it or not.” Kamugasa’s own style was always colourful and sumptuous. She counted many of Uganda’s best designers as friends. Santa Anzo, chief designer and MD of fashion label Arapapa, wrote of Kamugasa’s sudden death, “I can never tell my life journey without Kamugasa… She exuded so much life and we looked forward to a future that was looking so bright.” The warmth and wisdom of Kamugasa’s columns reflect the support she showed her fellow women in day-to-day life. Kamugasa held voluntary positions on the boards of several NGOs. She mentored many young women, frequently visiting schools to give talks on career advice and self-esteem. She was an enthusiastic advocate for women’s rights. While the Uganda constitution prohibits discrimination against women, inequality is still widespread. FGM is still common as is the practice of dowries. Women are still unable to inherit ahead of male relatives. Against this background, Kamugasa entered a male-dominated profession. Kamugasa’s colleague Cathy Mwesigwa, deputy editor of  , has said: “She stood up against the subtle forms of sexual harassment in the newsroom in the 1990s, when there were really few female journalists.” John Kakande, editor of  , wrote, “She has been a very interesting person who never covered up anything that she believed wasn’t right.” Kamugasa never married – she broke off an engagement in 2006 to a man she claimed “wanted to tame me”. A single mother who is survived by her daughter, she advised others to “follow your heart. Don’t get married because of pressure.” The journalist was sustained throughout her life by a strong Christian faith. In an interview for   in 2011, she said, “Celebrate life when you can. Life is either a funeral or a celebration. I choose to make it a celebration.” We use cookies to enhance your visit to our site and to bring you advertisements that might interest you.

" The American singer-songwriter and producer was on the cusp of becoming a household name having claimed the attention of fans and the press both in Britain and the US Like many creative suburban misfits, Gustav Åhr, who has died aged 21, didn’t get on with a lot of people in his town. He spent much of his teenage years alone in his bedroom, listening to rap and punk records – and ever more obscure acts he sourced in far corners of the internet. Åhr, better known by his stage name Lil Peep, was born in Pennsylvania and grew up in Long Island, New York. His parents were both Harvard graduates – they split up when he was a teenager. Although the rapper and music producer achieved good grades, he rarely turned up to his lessons at Long Beach High School in Lido Beach. Eventually he dropped out, opting to study online instead. The course he chose required submitting one essay a week and even that his mother would often have to write for him. At the age of 17, Åhr moved to Los Angeles in pursuit of a career in music. Under his new moniker, Peep released his first mixtape   in 2015. He followed this with an EP called   and another mixtape   in the same year. More EPs followed in 2016, and he released his debut album  , shortly before his death in August. Music came easily to Peep. “It takes me like five minutes to make a whole fucking song,” he said in an interview with   in February. Peep’s self-styled and memorable aesthetic opened doors for him. He had started getting tattoos at the age of 14 and gained Instagram fame for his distinctive look. He received catwalk invitations to Paris and Milan fashion weeks and was shot by Mario Testino. “They all say the same – that I’m edgy,” Peep told   in August. His notorious face tattoos featured the words “Get cake, die young” along his hairline, as well as “Crybaby,” the name of one of his songs, above his eye. His music blends elements of trap, emo, grunge and southern rock and is often categorised as belonging to the genre “SoundCloud rap”. Although placed in a rap category, Peep’s use of melody in his debut album aligns him closer with rock. In general, his music is more reminiscent of alt pop/punk bands of the 2000s, like Fall Out Boy and Panic! at the Disco.   SoundCloud is home to a nation of rappers and what it means to be a SoundCloud rapper shifts as the ecosystem evolves. Calling someone a “SoundCloud rapper” can be an insulting or dismissive term used to describe a musician who creates mediocre or mundane music for an extremely small and insignificant audience, but there also exists a distinct musical genre of “SoundCloud” rap. This genre’s ambient beats are characterised by an unpolished lo-fi sound, dominated by heavily distorted bass, and its artists’ punk rock personas and emotional lyrics that constantly reference suicide and prescription painkillers. This style of music is not only circulating on the platform but has entered the realm of mainstream record-label-vouched chart-topping music. Along with many other artists linked to the Soundcloud rap movement, Peep  unhappiness. He wrote songs for depressed teens with frank, emotional lyrics about mental illness. His 2016 track “OMFG” contains the line: “I used to wanna kill myself / Came up, still wanna kill myself / My life is goin’ nowhere / I want everyone to know that I don’t care.” When asked about the song in January,  , “I have a chemical imbalance in my brain. I suffer from depression and some days I wake up and I’m like, Fuck, I wish I didn’t wake up.” Peep also rapped about drug-taking and presented it in a way that was not always pleasure-less but was usually linked to his depressive tendencies and as a means of escapism, rather than straightforward hedonism. As witness the lyrics: “Gettin’ high ’cause my life don’t mean shit to me”; “I hear voices in my head, they tellin’ me to call it quits, I found some Xanax in my bed, I took that shit, went back to sleep.”  Along with marijuana and “purple” (or “lean,” a drink made from codeine-based cough syrup and sprite), Xanax – a benzodiazepine (“benzo”) often used to treat depression and anxiety – is a popular drug of choice referenced in “SoundCloud” rap. Fellow rapper Lil Pump celebrated a million Instagram followers with a Xanax-shaped cake; a group called the Cozy Boys – formerly known as Blackout Boys – had a Xanax bar-inspired logo; and even clean-cut Drake guest-starred on iLoveMakonnen’s track Tuesday, admitting to having “Xans in an Advil bottle” before reassuring us that “I don’t take them shits but you do.” The stultified flow and numb production of SoundCloud rap replicates the anti-high of Xanax. It demonstrates a marked change in rap’s drug culture which previously depicted drugs as a means of getting pleasure or money, and ignored their use as a negative mode of escape. Depression and drug-taking have become so disconcertingly entwined that it is impossible to distinguish which artists are genuinely troubled and which, like the fake gangster rappers of the crack era, are appropriating the misplaced allure of drug-related pain. Over 5 per cent of adults in the US take some form of benzo and an estimated 10 to 25 per cent of longtime users are dependent. Since 2000, the US has witnessed a 500 per cent increase in the overdose death rate. Michael Jackson, Elvis Presley, Heath Ledger, and Whitney Houston all had benzos in their system when they died. In October, President Trump directed acting Health Secretary Eric Hargan to declare the opioid crisis a nationwide emergency under the Public Health Services Act. Use and abuse is growing in the UK also, where benzos are less readily available on prescription but sourced on the street or from the dark web and used by people to help bring them down after nights on other drugs they’ve taken. Though abuse isn’t on the level of the US,   were killed by benzo-related overdoses in 2015 in the UK (compared with 9,000 in the US) – but that’s still higher than cocaine, speed, or MDMA. In a flurry of haunting posts on his Instagram ahead of his final show, Lil Peep posted a photo of himself with an unidentified substance broken into pieces on his tongue. He filmed himself dropping bars of Xanax into his mouth. Last month Peep was found unresponsive in his tour bus ahead of a scheduled show in Tucson, Arizona. According to a toxicology report conducted by the Pima County Medical Examiner, he died of an overdose as a result of “combined toxic effects of fentanyl and alprazolam [Xanax].” It said that the “manner of death” was “accidental”. Fentanyl is a prescription painkiller that gives relief from chronic diseases and is said to be 30 to 50 times as powerful as heroin. The Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) has launched an investigation to find the person who gave the fentanyl to Peep. Officials are interested in a series of group Twitter messages allegedly sent by a  . One said: “Gbc [Lil Peep] high af because of me and my friend lol” and that he was “passed the fuck out” and “wouldn’t wake up”. Before the report’s conclusion that ruled out suicide, Peep’s brother claimed it to have been an accident because his brother had been very happy prior to his death, adding, “He was so proud when he heard that there were people in the world who wanted to kill themselves, and then they didn’t because they listened to his music. He was helping people, he was not somebody who needed help… He was not as sad as people think he was. It’s frustrating as someone who remembers a happy brother.” Peep’s two-year music career was impactful and memorials for the rapper took place on both sides of the Atlantic. On 2 December, Lil Peep’s face was projected onto the House Of Commons at midnight while on the same day his family and friends paid tribute to him at a service in Long Beach, California. World-renowned DJ and producer Diplo tweeted: “Peep had so much more to do… he was constantly inspiring me” and 2017’s chart-topping rapper Post Malone said: “Your music changed the world and it’ll never be the same.”  We use cookies to enhance your visit to our site and to bring you advertisements that might interest you.

" Lord Jenkin served in the Thatcher Cabinet but was not ‘one of us’. Aged 86, he championed same-sex marriage in the Lords, before retiring and urging ‘extinct volcanoes’ among his colleagues to follow suit Had any Labour Member of Parliament in the 1964-66 session been asked “If there is a Tory government in the 1980s or 1990s, who would you think would be the Prime Minister?” most of us would have said Christopher Chataway, Terence Higgins, Geoffrey Howe or – most likely – Patrick Jenkin. It would not have occurred to us to opt for the former Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Pensions, Margaret Thatcher: and 10 years would go by before John Major would even be elected to the Commons. Patrick Jenkin was chosen from among a teeming number of Conservative aspirants for a very special seat indeed – that of Woodford in Essex, which for the previous four decades had sent the same personage to Parliament: Winston Churchill. In his maiden speech on 18 November 1964, Jenkin gave a taste of the graceful charm and felicitous language that characterised his public life: I intervene in this debate with even more diffidence than new Members are encouraged to display. For many maiden speakers, the tradition that one is expected to pay a graceful compliment to one’s predecessor comes as a welcome support during the first hesitant sentences. It is pleasant to be magnanimous, as the Member for Epping [Stanley Newens] was, to an opponent whom one has just defeated. It is not too difficult to pay due tribute to a Member who has retired. In my case, the position is far different, for I have the enormous privilege of representing the constituency which for the last 40 years has been represented by Sir Winston Churchill. What can I say about that great man that has not already been said with far more eloquence by those far more fitted to say it than I am? And he went on to pay tribute to Churchill in a very moving and unpretentious style. I saw the knights of the shires nodding and grunting their approval of how the “young fellow” expressed himself. He was on his way. Patrick Jenkin was born the son of Charles Jenkin, a distinguished industrial chemist, in Edinburgh in 1926. In the late 1930s the family were in the United States with a senior job and so it came about that Jenkin’s “puppy schools” were American. This had a lasting effect, as he had an American attitude to enterprise and impatience with controls. On the outbreak of war he returned to the Dragon School in Oxford, and entrance to Clifton College. During his National Service, 1945-48, he was commissioned with a Scottish regiment, the Queen’s Own Cameron Highlanders, with whom he served abroad on combat duty. Though not a Scot by gene, in spite of his Celtic good looks, he took a lasting interest in the constitutional problems which have emerged between Scotland and England, often recalling that he had been born in the Scottish capital and had served for three years with “Jocks”. Arriving at Jesus College, Cambridge, a maturish student of 22, he took a first class honours degree in Law and in 1951 was Harmsworth Scholar at the Middle Temple. I saw him at close quarters on a succession of Finance Bill committee stages and even such seasoned financial bill aficionados and Joe Barnett and Robert Sheldon agree that he was an outstandingly capable lawyer. He was called to the Bar in 1952, but wisely, as an ambitious politician, he joined the Distillers Company to gain industrial experience. He also prepared himself for political office through membership of the Hornsey Borough Council, where he lost his seat in May 1963 as a result of strong attacks on the trade unions. In particular he attacked the lack of competition in the road haulage industry in a submission to the Guinness Committee. In 1964, as a new MP, he took a very active part in the campaign of Ted Heath against Reginald Maudling for the leadership of the Conservative Party. He became almost immediately one of Heath’s trusted inner circle. After the 1966 general election Jenkin, who had not put a foot wrong in mounting the ladder of political preferment, did one of those thoughtless things which can be a millstone round the neck of a politician for the simple reason that the lapse is remembered by his parliamentary colleagues. On 21 July 1966 on the order paper as question eight to the Prime Minister Jenkin asked who gave authority for the use of official car, registered number 919 CLD, on Friday 1 July to convey Professor T Balogh and a lady from Hampstead to the West End of London; and why an official car was put at Professor Balogh’s disposal on this occasion. Harold Wilson was beside himself that his close friend and economic adviser, a tutor at Balliol College, Oxford, who had a heart problem, should be treated in this way: The use of this car to bring Dr Balogh to the Cabinet Office had been authorised under the normal rules governing the use of official cars. The lady who travelled in the car on this occasion was another member of the Cabinet Office staff, who travelled with him in order to discuss necessary official business. Pandemonium broke out. Jenkin asked a supplementary question: Will the Prime Minister confirm that there has been no change in the list of persons designated in a very long reply on 3 December 1951 by the then Prime Minister, Mr Churchill, of the people who are entitled to use official cars for personal use on the grounds they require police protection? Fury was unleashed. The Prime Minister, to thunderous applause from the Labour benches, rebuked Jenkin, who was reduced at that moment to an unpleasant whippersnapper. If the honourable gentleman had not withdrawn this morning the question he had intended to put, he would have had the full answer to the effect that the rules regarding the use of official cars are exactly the same as those carried out by our predecessors. As for Dr Balogh, as the House knows, he had a very severe heart attack last year. Outrage. Honourable Members opposite, I know, are capable of sinking pretty low on occasion. In accordance with the rules, he was authorised to be brought into work by car. I suggest to the honourable Member, who boasted to the press that he had followed this car around in his own car for mile after mile, that if his hobby is collecting motor-car numbers he would be better employed consulting my honourable friend the Member for West Ham, North [Arthur Lewis, a colourful Member associated with road protest], who could teach him a lot about numbers. There followed cutting references from Charles Pannell, the former Minister of Public Buildings and Works responsible for ministerial cars, who elicited from Wilson the response that the Government had not used its backbenchers to drive round London to spy on others; from Willie Hamilton, who called it a “squalid exercise”; from Manny Shinwell, who wanted Heath to “repudiate” Jenkin; and from Archie Manuel, who told him in railway man’s language to get “back into the sewers”. In the next third of the century, in which I had a great deal to do with him, Jenkin never again did anything demeaning. In fact he managed to regain his reputation with Labour MPs because he was one of the 26 Tories who had voted for Harold Wilson’s sanctions against Ian Smith in Southern Rhodesia and continued to be brave about the problems of southern Africa. In June 1970 he was appointed Financial Secretary, the third in seniority as a Treasury minister. I have never seen him so overcome with grief as on the day when his Chancellor, Iain Macleod, died in July 1970. The essence of his economic attitude can be summarised by his maiden speech on 13 November 1970 as a Treasury minister: I say simply that the Government were elected on 18 June [1970] among other things to end the process whereby government expenditure rose year by year faster than the growth of the economy, resulting inevitably and inexorably year by year in an increased burden of taxation on the backs of the British people. This process was not only a major contributory cause of slow growth but was undoubtedly part of a cause of inflation. [Conservative] measures represent the beginning of the reversal of that process. Jenkin was promoted to the No 2 spot under the new Chancellor, Anthony Barber, in April 1972 as Chief Secretary. He always regretted that he didn’t express more forcefully his doubts about the soaring money supply. Just before the miners’ strike he was promoted Minister of Energy. Politicians have the misfortune of being remembered not for solid work but for one or two silly things which they might have done and, in truth, Jenkin made himself the object of ribald comment by urging that the nation save energy by toothbrushing in the dark. It also became clear that he used an electric razor, and the lights in his house were noticed to be unnecessarily bright. In opposition his career flourished under Heath but on Margaret Thatcher’s becoming leader Jenkin was not “one of us”. However, his position in the party meant that he could not be demoted and he established a   with the new opposition leadership being responsible for health. He argued for tax credit systems and against National Health Service trade unions’ assuming too much power. From his American experience, it weighed with him that a substantial proportion of bankruptcy in the United States came about as a result of the high costs of medicine and that the National Health Service in Britain, for all its shortcomings, was more satisfactory than the system in the United States. In 1977 and 1978 he was one of few Conservatives who really gave his mind to the problems of Scotland and helped to rally his colleagues devote in favour of George Cunningham’s amendment and the 40 per cent rule on Scottish devolution. When Margaret Thatcher came to Downing Street in 1979 Jenkin took over the huge department of Health and Social Security. He defended the cuts in social benefits and liberated consultants to practise privately after fulfilling their commitments to the National Health Service. Making his first speech as Secretary of State on 13 June 1979 he said: “We will pay a Christmas bonus of £10 this year, and will take powers to pay it in subsequent years, fixing the amount by order. I hope to introduce the necessary legislation shortly.” His critics thought that he was too prone to give cheap, popular solutions to enormous problems of resources. In September 1981 he was switched – not promoted – to Industry, replacing Sir Keith Joseph. It was suspected that his heart was not in the cutbacks in industrial assistance which Thatcher was demanding to the huge detriment of many long established firms in British industry. It was the source of huge disappointment when Thatcher created the Trade and Industry department and gave it to Cecil Parkinson. Jenkin had hoped at least to head the new department or, better still, go to the job which he really wanted – that of Chancellor of the Exchequer. Perhaps he ought to have realised that in no way would Margaret Thatcher have him as her neighbour at 11 Downing Street. Environment was not a happy time for him. He was involved in enormous rows about the abolition of the Greater London Council and the Metropolitan Council. His rate-capping bill in January 1984 was very unpopular with many parliamentary colleagues and his rate-support grant proposals provoked a rebellion led by of all people Francis Pym, former Chief Whip and Foreign Secretary, who was incandescent with anger about the way that his Cambridgeshire councillors were being treated. Jenkin’s cabinet career came to a not unanticipated end. It is hugely to Patrick Jenkin’s credit that he did not sulk or withdraw from public life. On the contrary, after he left the Commons in 1987 and was ennobled as Lord Jenkin of Roding, he threw himself into a whole number of useful activities. I saw him repeatedly as chairman of the Foundation for Science and Technology where he succeeded Lord Butterworth as host in the Royal Society to those very useful off-the-record fortnightly dinner meetings. His industrial experience involved Arthur Andersen, the management consultant, Provident Life, the Thames Estuary Airport Company, Lamco Paper Sales, and the chairmanship of Crystalate Holdings. He was one of the least bitter ex-cabinet ministers whom I have known. In all the ups and downs of his life he was superbly supported by Alison his wife and his family, one of whom, Bernard Jenkin, is the Conservative MP for Harwich and North Essex.

" Humphrey Bogart was among supporters who believed the five-year jail sentence she served was for a crime that had been staged by her accuser The true story of actress Madge Meredith, who died on 19 September at the age of 96, is every bit as compelling as the plots of the B-movies in which she made her name. Born Marjorie May Massow in Iowa Falls, she overcame a stammer to win a scholarship to the Rice School of Theatre in Massachusetts. Then, after a spell in New York, she headed for Hollywood. Her big break came when she was talent spotted while working as a cashier in the cafeteria at 20th Century Fox. On the condition that she get a nose-job, she was given a contract and her first small role in Phil Baker’s 1944 comedy  . In 1945, Marjorie Massow became Madge Meredith. With her career in the hands of a new manager – Nicholas “The Greek” Gianaclis – Meredith seemed set for stardom.  A part in Randolph Scott’s   was going to be her breakthrough. However before the film was released, Meredith and Gianaclis fell out over a property deal. Gianaclis evicted Meredith from a house he’d helped her buy in the Hollywood Hills. She subsequently successfully sued him for possession of the property. But within days of winning back the deeds to her home, Meredith was under arrest, after Gianaclis claimed she’d hired three hit men to kidnap both him and his bodyguard.  After a four-week trial, in front of a jury of 11 women and one man, Meredith and the hitmen she’d supposedly hired were convicted of two counts of kidnapping, assault with a deadly weapon and conspiracy. She was sentenced to five years. As she was sent to Tehachapi prison, she told the press “I know in my own heart I’m innocent of any crime.” Humphrey Bogart believed her. As did fellow actress ZaSu Pitts, who began a letter writing campaign to have Meredith freed. Pitts’s campaign attracted the attention of amateur sleuths, retired banker Herbert Schofield and Charles E Wilson, a retired real estate broker. They worked hard to unravel the truth of Meredith’s case and in 1951, a breakthrough came when Meredith’s co-defendant, Albert Turner, suggested that Gianaclis had staged his own kidnapping. He claimed married Gianaclis was motivated by thwarted “personal affection” for his actress client. Meredith left prison on 15 July 951, her 30th birthday, having spent two and a half years inside. Reporting on her release the   wrote, “She ran from the main entrance and refused to look back as the big chain link gates … clanged shut on the past…”    With his perjury revealed, Gianaclis lost his American citizenship. Meanwhile Meredith won back her house for a second time and returned to acting, gaining roles in  ,   and   among others. A credit on  marked her official retirement from acting in 1964.   Meredith devoted her retirement to fighting for fellow victims of injustice.   However she is thought to have appeared as an uncredited extra in Kevin Costner’s 1995 sci-fi extravaganza  .  The legendarily expensive feature was filmed in Hawaii, where Meredith made her home. She is survived by her husband Mack Hatayama and their two children, a son and a daughter. Mourners at her funeral were invited to wear “Aloha attire”.

" The highly-decorated test pilot was the first woman to break the sound barrier in a MiG-21, earning the nickname ‘Madam Mig’ Popovich ​Popovich, who has died aged 86, had no time for dolls. Born Marina Lavrentievna Vasiliyeva in the village of Leonenki in Smollensk, her childhood was marked by Nazi violence. She later explained that her decision to become a pilot rose out of a need for vengeance. Popovich went to extreme measures to achieve her ambitions. After her rejection by the flying club, she asked friends to hang her upside down by the feet in an attempt to stretch herself to the right height.  She succeeded, growing 11cm in one year. A little later, she added six years to her age in order to enter the Soviet Air Force Academy. The USSR was not recruiting female test pilots but Popovich secured a personal reference from prominent military figure Kliment Voroshilov to help change the recruiters’ minds.       By 1964, Popovich was a military test pilot. During her career, she tested more than 50 aeroplanes and broke more than a 100 aviation world-endurance records; including the longest ever flight by a female pilot. She was the first woman to break the sound barrier in a MiG-21, earning her the nickname “Madam Mig”. Ten of her record-breaking flights were undertaken alone in the Soviet Antonov An-22, the world’s heaviest turboprop plane (an aircraft whose propellers are driven by a turboprop engine).  She was decorated dozens of times over. During the Soviet era she was awarded Hero of Socialist Labour. She bore the Order of the Red Banner, the Order of the Red Star, the Order of the Badge of Honour and the Order of the Gold Star. In 2007, she was given the Order of Courage by Vladimir Putin. She was an honorary citizen of Samarkand. Having retired from flying, Popovich turned to writing. She authored 18 books, including one of poetry, a biography of her first husband Cosmonaut Pavel Popovich, and two screenplays. Most famous are her books on extra-terrestrial life. In her 2003 tome  , she said military and civilian pilots from the USSR had reported more than 3,000 UFO sightings. In addition, she wrote, Moscow is in possession fragments of five separate UFOs. In 1990, the then Colonel Popovich held a press conference at the Russian Consulate in San Francisco, at which she showed photographs of a cigar-shaped alien craft measuring 15 miles long. She also claimed to have seen photographs of alien/human hybrid children. As recently as 2014, Popovich was planning to lobby the US government to lift its embargo on the reporting of UFO sightings by its own astronauts, believing there are valuable insights to be shared. In a book co-authored with Drs Victoria Popova and Lidia Andrianova, Popovich wrote: “Extra-terrestrial civilisations (ETC) warn: the weakening of Earth's magnetic field has reached a critical value, and threatens the life of mankind. ETC’s instructions in crop circles indicate how to escape from global cataclysms which will begin very soon.” Popovich was buried with full military honours in the Federal Military Memorial Cemetery in Moscow. Married twice, she had two daughters with Pavel Popovich. She later married Boris Alexandrovich Zhikhorev, a retired Russian Airforce Major General. She had three grandchildren. A star in the constellation of Cancer bears her name. We use cookies to enhance your visit to our site and to bring you advertisements that might interest you.

" She brought joy to millions by plucking unknowns out of obscurity and won international recognition for her innovative and offbeat formats Patricia Llewellyn, who has died of breast cancer aged 55, was an award-winning TV producer, a singular presence in a work environment dominated by men. She excelled at spotting fresh, if not necessarily obvious, talent and inventing new TV shows that became global hits.  Launching BBC cooking programme   in the Nineties, Llewellyn made household names of Jennifer Paterson and Clarissa Dickson Wright. She also launched the TV careers of Jamie Oliver and Gordon Ramsay, breaking the staid ways of old formats, revolutionising cookery on the small screen and inspiring a generation of gastronomically challenged men to try their hand at cooking. Her Midas touch also made a star of Mary Portas. Llewellyn was an astute businesswoman. With her husband Ben Adler, she defied the odds in growing their company Optomen Productions, which was worth around £7m at the start of the 2008 recession, to nearly £60m in 2014. She once described her approach to picking presenters as “a weird mixture of gut feeling, liking people and common sense”. Television, she noted, was “not good with shrinking violets. It likes big personalities, people with charisma ... people who know stuff, not auto-cuties.” Although not what she had intended when younger, it was not such a far cry from her childhood upbringing. She was born in Carmarthen in 1962 to Anne and Eric, who ran the Emlyn Arms, a hotel in the town of Newcastle Emlyn. This inspired her lifelong interest in, and love of, food. As a child, her mother used to sit her on a beer barrel outside the hotel kitchen door and keep her busy by giving her a quail to eat. She was educated at Netherwood Boarding School in Saundersfoot, before attending Westonbirt Girls’ School, near Tetbury, in Gloucestershire. Llewellyn then read for a degree in French and film at Middlesex Polytechnic (now Middlesex University), including a year at the Sorbonne, Paris, after which she completed an MA in film studies at the Polytechnic of Central London (now the University of Westminster). Inspired by her studies, she went to the British Universities Film & Video Council before getting a job at Channel 4, as an assistant in the education department. There Llewellyn was encouraged to get into production by Sue Shephard, a commissioning editor who recognised her latent talent. In 1992, Llewellyn began working at the production company Wall To Wall as a director on a cookery show with Sophie Grigson. It was here that she met Adler, a researcher. Their start was frosty, although when their paths crossed again at Optomen, when Adler was appointed as their new head of development, any enmity soon turned to mutual enthusiasm. They married in 2002. She developed   (1993) for Wall to Wall, and joined Optomen in 1994, where she created  , a ratings sensation for ITV. She would later become managing director of Optomen from 2005 to 2016. Llewellyn introduced Jennifer Paterson and   Dickson Wright and added a sidecar, and ‘Two Fat Ladies’ was born (Rex) It was during the filming of   that Llewellyn first met Clarissa Dickson Wright, then a recovering alcoholic, working in a cookery bookshop in Edinburgh. Shortly afterwards, she lunched with Jennifer Paterson, a cook and columnist at   – she had a “eureka” moment when she saw Paterson speed off on a motorbike. Ignoring the advice of others, who believed there was no appetite for “large, posh middle-aged ladies” on television cooking old-fashioned dinner-party food, Llewellyn introduced the two cooks and added a sidecar – and, in 1996,   was born; it became TV gold.  With its emphasis on “suet and tipsy cake rather than rocket salad and sun-dried tomatoes”, the pilot spawned four series and became the most-watched cookery programme in the mid-Nineties, attracting more than 3.5 million viewers a week, as well as a global audience of 70 million. Its two starts charmed with their eccentricity, politically incorrect views, zest for lard, clotted cream and fatty meats. Dickson Wright memorably explained about the proper application of butter to a cake tin: “You really want to get it well-greased. Did you see  ? Something like that.”  Spin-off book   became a bestseller; the show and the book went on to further success in America and Australia. Paterson referred to Llewellyn as “our Doctor Frankenstein”. Flushed with success, Llewellyn believed younger chefs were needed on TV; she spotted a young, fresh-faced Jamie Oliver chopping spinach in the background of a documentary about the River Café in London. “This is the guy,” she told colleagues at Optomen.   The BBC, however, was not easily convinced.  , in which Llewellyn’s voice was heard in each episode asking Oliver questions about what he was cooking, sat on the shelf for five months before being broadcast, in 1999, and it was not until the last few episodes of the first series that audience figures rocketed. Oliver soon became Optomen’s major earner, with spin-off books and secondary rights helping to keep the company profitable, a situation which came to an abrupt end when, after the third series, Oliver realised how lucrative the show had become and decided to set up his own production company. He did, however, later acknowledge her “huge impact” on his early TV career and called her “one of the most gifted matriarchs of the TV industry”. Llewellyn said Oliver’s departure taught her a valuable business lesson, “not to put all your eggs in one basket”. In 2004, she brought Gordon Ramsay to prominence on Channel 4 in  , transforming him from a terrifying, swearing chef off-screen into an engaging, swearing one on camera, where he ‘“fixed” struggling restaurants. They would co-found One Potato Two Potato, a joint venture production company, to produce all of his television series, including  . The company opened a Los Angeles office in 2010, which Llewellyn ran with her husband. Her other credits included   (2009), with experimental chef Heston Blumenthal. Llewellyn also acted as co-producer of several American cookery and reality television programmes, such as  ,  , Hotel Hell, and  . Away from the culinary world, Llewellyn pioneered the cop-video format and introduced the archaeologist and historian Neil Oliver to television audiences in T on BBC2 in 2000. Then the BBC2 series Mary Queen Of Shops (2007) launched the career of television marketing guru Mary Portas; this too became a hit. She was also executive producer for   (2004), a Bafta-nominated documentary for Channel 4, which introduced bemused and horrified audiences to the foul-mouthed residents of Great Fulford, an 800-year old crumbling manor house in Devon. Llewellyn won her first Bafta for   and two more (plus an International Emmy and a Grierson Award) for  .   won a Royal Television Society Award, and in 2002 she won the Independent Spirit Award at the annual Glenfiddich Food and Drink Awards.  Former BBC2 controller Mark Thompson said: “ , which placed Jamie’s food in a friends and family lived-in documentary context, was spectacularly influential in the development of factual TV. I think she was the single most important creator of the new wave of food shows which eventually swept the world.” According to Adler, Llewellyn “was a foodie in that she loved talking and reading about food, but most of all she loved eating it”. One of her favourite dishes to cook was tagliatelle with courgettes, parmesan, chilli and anchovies, which her husband described as “salty and unctuous with a delicious kick”. She is survived by her husband. We use cookies to enhance your visit to our site and to bring you advertisements that might interest you. Read our   and   Policies to find out more.

" The photographs stunned the America: a 14-year-old boy dead in a coffin, his head crushed, an eye gouged, his body disfigured beyond recognition from an agony in which he was beaten, shot, tied with barbed wire to a weight and submerged in the   River of Mississippi. The young man was  . His murder in 1955 – punishment for the transgression of whistling at or otherwise offending a white woman – became the most infamous of the thousands of lynchings inflicted on African-American people in the segregated South. Till’s death galvanised the civil rights movement, but only after Simeon Booker helped deliver the story to a national audience. Few reporters risked more to chronicle the civil rights movement than Booker. He was the first full-time black reporter for  , serving on the newspaper’s staff for two years before joining Johnson Publishing to write for  , a weekly, and  , a monthly modelled on Life magazine, in 1954 – he was their Washington bureau chief for five decades. From home bases in Chicago and later in Washington, Booker ventured into the South and sent back dispatches that reached readers all over America. He was in Chicago, Till’s hometown, when he heard that the young man had disappeared while visiting relatives in Money, Mississippi. Booker instinctively went to the home of the young man’s mother, Mamie Till-Mobley, and earned her trust while she was in a state of grief. He was with her at the funeral home where, over the objections of everyone present, she insisted that the casket bearing her son’s mutilated corpse be opened. Booker described the scene in  : “Her face wet with tears, she leaned over the body, just removed from a rubber bag in a Chicago funeral home, and cried out, ‘Darling, you have not died in vain. Your life has been sacrificed for something’.” photographer, David Jackson, took images of Till’s body, which thousands of mourners observed at his funeral. No mainstream news outlets published the images of Till’s body, according to an account decades later in  . But their appearance in   and several other African-American publications helped make the Till murder “the first great media event of the civil rights movement,” historian David Halberstam wrote in his 1993 book  . Like Till, Booker grew up in the US’s North and said he had never entered the Deep South before travelling to Mississippi to cover the trial of Till’s accused killers, Roy Bryant and JW Milam. An all-white jury acquitted the defendants after deliberations lasting roughly an hour. Later, Bryant and Milam confessed to the killing. Booker was in constant peril as a black journalist reporting in the South. But the Till case presented particular dangers. “The first day we got there we went over to Till’s grand-uncle’s house and men in a car with guns forced us to stop” Booker told the  . After the verdict, he recalled, “the first thing we had to think about was getting to Memphis and getting out of there, because we were marked men. And they put us all on one plane, the reporters and witnesses and everybody.” Booker later became bureau chief in Washington and established the Johnson company’s office in the capital. After a lengthy search for accommodations in the then-segregated city, Booker and his colleagues found two rooms in the Standard Oil building on the city’s Constitution Avenue. As one of the few black reporters in Washington, he wrote a column for   called “Ticker Tape USA” and led editorial coverage of US politics at a time when black reporters were as excluded from news events as they were from everyday life. He covered 10 presidents and travelled to Southeast Asia to report on the Vietnam War. And then he returned to the South, documenting the civil rights struggle. For his safety, he sometimes posed as a minister, carrying a Bible under his arm. Other times, he discarded his usual suit and bow tie and for overalls to look the part of a sharecropper. Once, in an incident retold when Booker was inducted into the National Association of Black Journalists’ Hall of Fame in 2013, he escaped a mob by riding in the back of a hearse. He wrote that he was “never prouder of  ’s role in any story” than in 1961, when he helped cover a Freedom Ride from Washington to New Orleans, an interracial effort to test compliance with a ban on segregated interstate transit. A mob firebombed one of the buses in Anniston, Alabama. Thugs forced their way aboard Booker’s coach and beat the protesters. In Birmingham, Alabama, Ku Klux Klansmen waited to beat them again. With help from the office of US Attorney General Robert Kennedy, Booker and the Freedom Riders were eventually flown to safety. But such demonstrations continued, and integration was enforced in interstate travel. Booker was in Baltimore where his father, a Baptist minister, was the director of a YMCA for black people. The family later moved to Youngstown, Ohio, where his father opened another YMCA. “From an early age, I knew I wanted to be a writer,” Booker told a Youngstown newspaper. “Teaching and preaching were the best advances for blacks at the time. But I wanted to write.” He received an English degree in 1942 from Virginia Union University, a historically black institution in Richmond, then began his career at the  . He later joined the Cleveland  , also an African-American publication, where he received a Newspaper Guild award for a series covering slum housing – and where he was fired for trying to unionise the staff. In 1950, after several previous applications, he received a prestigious Nieman Foundation fellowship for journalism at Harvard University. With that under his belt, Booker wrote to numerous newspapers seeking employment. “The only one to answer me,” he told   years later, was the newspaper’s former publisher Phil Graham. Graham had told Booker, “If you can take it, I’m willing to gamble.” By that he meant the unrelenting difficulty Booker would encounter in the segregated capital. Indeed, when the new recruit introduced himself as “Simeon Booker from  ,” people laughed. “If I went out to [the scene of a hold-up], they thought I was one of the damn hold-up men,” Booker told  . “I couldn’t get any cooperation.” Booker said he eventually determined that   wasn’t “prepared” to have a black reporter on its staff. “It was all new to them, having a black guy in the newsroom,” he recalled. “It was recommended to me that I only use the bathroom on the fourth floor – editorial – so I did. I could eat in the cafeteria, and I was thankful for that. But I was always alone.” After a two-year tenure that he described as a “social experiment,” he joined publishing company Johnson. Gene Roberts and Hank Klibanoff describe in their Pulitzer prize-winning book   (2006) that in Booker’s time, African-American newspapers were suffering crippling circulation losses. The Johnson magazines offered the alluring opportunity to reach vast national audiences, and Booker remained with the company until his retirement, around his 90th birthday. In his reporting, Booker developed a working relationship with Cartha “Deke” DeLoach, a top aide to J Edgar Hoover at the FBI, and credited the bureau with helping keep him safe when he travelled to the South. He described the FBI as “a kind of co-engineer with us,” adding that “ and  never would have been what we were without the FBI.” His account appeared in conflict with later discoveries by historians that the FBI had sought to undercut Martin Luther King Jr and the movement he led. David J Garrow, a Pulitzer-winning historian, told   that Booker’s flattering accounts of the FBI were “one of the most hilarious snow jobs in American history.” Booker described the relationship as simply a matter of staying alive. “Maybe [they] looked at me as some kind of informer. I was giving them information – far as where I was going, who I was going to cover – and they were giving me information about staying safe,” he told  . “I’d have never gotten into the South were it not for J Edgar Hoover and Deke DeLoach. DeLoach saved my neck more times than I can remember.” More than three decades earlier, he had received the National Press Club’s Fourth Estate Award. At the awards ceremony, he recalled that he had “one compelling ambition.” “I wanted to fight segregation on the front lines,” he said. “I wanted to dedicate my writing skills to the cause. Segregation was beating down my people. I volunteered for every assignment and suggested more. I stayed on the road, covering civil rights day and night. The names, the places and the events became history.” We use cookies to enhance your visit to our site and to bring you advertisements that might interest you.

" She enjoyed successes at the British National Time Trial, National Road Race and UCI Road World Championships, but it was her selfless attitude that propelled colleagues on Team GB to Olympic gold in Beijing “I was not one of those girls that competed from the age of six and was born to race a bike.” These were the words of Sharon Laws, looking back at her surprising late-blossoming sporting career for  , for which she regularly blogged, in February last year. Born in Nairobi, Kenya, in 1974, Laws spent most of her childhood in Bourton-on-the-Water, an idyllic Cotswold village in Gloucestershire. With a degree in biology under her belt, she took a masters in conservation at the University of London and then kicked off her career as an environmental consultant. But a chance meeting in 2001 with endurance athlete Anna McCormack changed her life’s direction in a most unexpected way.  McCormack invited Laws to join a birthday party weekend with some of the UK’s best adventure cyclists. She lent Laws her bike, and by the time the weekend was over, Laws was hooked. A week later Laws bought a bike of her own and threw herself into adventure racing. She kept up her interest when her work took her to South Africa. There she bought her first road bike – and had to ask where the brakes were. Coming back to London to take a job at Kew Gardens put paid to her racing for a while but a move to Melbourne in 2007 saw her join the Australian road cycling scene in earnest.  In January 2008 she finished second in the Australian National Road Race, much to her own surprise and that of her coach of three weeks, Donna Rae Szalinski. After her Australian success, Laws was asked by the British Cycle Federation to take a sabbatical from her consulting to race with Team GB. She left her job and turned professional, riding first for Team Halfords Bikehut. Laws wasn’t sure it would work out. “Statistically, I was unlikely to become a professional – let alone at the age of 34 with no background in cycling,” she wrote in her   in March. But her one-year sabbatical turned into nine and during her professional career she raced for some of the biggest teams in women’s cycling, including Holland’s AA Drink-leontien.nl, Belgium’s Lotto-Belisol Ladies, UnitedHealthcare Pro in the US and 2011’s international Garmin-Cervélo. Though cycling doesn’t always look like a team sport to outsiders, Laws was revered by her teammates as the ultimate   – a cyclist who rides for the benefit of the team rather than personal glory. For example, a domestique cycles ahead of the star rider to provide an energy-preserving slipstream until the crucial moment when the star can break from the pack and go for a win. Domestiques provide tactical and mechanical support. They may even sacrifice their bike. In 2008, Laws proved her team spirit when she joined Team GB for the Beijing Olympics. Though she had broken her left leg just weeks before flying to China, she returned to form just in time to compete, and her selfless efforts enabled Nicole Cooke to win gold in the road race. More success followed but Laws was a surprise omission from the 2012 Olympic Team. It was a decision that looked especially odd when Laws went on to have her best season ever, becoming that year’s British Road Race champion and taking a bronze medal in the World Championships. Laws retired from professional cycling in August 2016. Two months later she announced that she had been diagnosed with cervical cancer, describing her condition as “treatable but not curable”. She continued to ride throughout her chemotherapy treatment, even tackling the notoriously difficult Taiwan Challenge. In a diary of the difficult mountain event for  , Laws wrote: “All that is certain is that I have to make the most of every day and the opportunities I’m given… For this event, I’d travelled for 24 hours, I’d met new people who didn’t know what I was going through, or why I had a silly hairstyle, I’d laughed at jokes and I’d had brief moments during the climb when I forgot I had cancer… I finally felt like I was me again.” Fellow road-racing cyclists Emma Pooley and Iris Slappendel said in a statement: “Athletic talents aside, Laws was one of the most beloved riders in the peloton, and her loss was felt deeply. Laws was an incredibly caring, humble and inspirational woman who lived life to the fullest.” We use cookies to enhance your visit to our site and to bring you advertisements that might interest you.

" She performed roles of empowered women that challenged the strictures of a conservative society – one of her songs became an anthem in the 2011 revolution Egyptian actor and singer Fatima Ahmed Kamal Shaker, better known by her stage name Shadia, played more than 100 roles in films, television series and radio plays, and recorded dozens of singles during a career that spanned from 1947 to 1984. She was one of the most prominent stars in Egypt, and also enjoyed a broad fanbase in the rest of the Arab world After undergoing surgery in America to remove a cyst, Shadia is said to have immediately travelled to Mecca to complete the Umrah pilgrimage. She had always been a practising Muslim, but Egypt was headed in an ever-more religiously conservative direction. Socioeconomic problems and new President Anwar Sadat’s relative tolerance towards political parties contributed to the rapid growth of Islamists who were intolerant of people who did not share their worldview. Shadia joined around 20 other Egyptian actresses who began wearing the hijab in the 1980s and 1990s. In her retirement, she opted to live a more secluded, devout and religious life.

" A black power salute cost Sol   his athletic career, but he returned to both sport and politics to fight for a people demanding recognition in their own country “I’m Sol Bellear, a Bundjalung man. I come from a little place called Mullumbimby.” That’s how the Australian civil rights activist, who has died aged 64, introduced himself on the website of the New South Wales Aboriginal Land Council. The Bundjalung tribal lands of New South Wales were Bellear’s birthplace and the place he held closest to his heart but his outlook was by no means parochial. ​Bellear was born in 1950 or 1951; around 300,000 of Australia’s indigenous peoples, virtually half its population of 770,000, do not have their births registered – there is now a government programme encouraging them to do so. There were five girls and four boys in Bellear’s family, though one of his sisters would die in childhood. Bellear was a keen sportsman and in his late teens he joined local rugby league team, the South Sydney Rabbitohs. Bellear, however, could not ignore the fact of belonging to an oppressed people. “That hard-on racism I got when I moved to Sydney I could not believe,” he later said. “It was shocking; it was really, really horrible.” Inspired by the civil rights movement in the United States, he dared to give a black power salute after scoring a try. He was dropped as a player from the squad. It was 1967. Australia was voting in a referendum that proposed to include Indigenous Australians in the census and change the constitution to allow the government to make laws for Aboriginal people. Those who were against including indigenous people in the census feared it would change the balance of the number of seats each state held in parliament. More Indigenous Australians meant more seats and more power for states such as New South Wales. “Things should be so much better for Aboriginal people,” he told  . “I think the country saw 1967 as the end of the fight. Before 1967, we weren’t counted in the census or anything as people. Dogs and cats and pigs and sheep were counted in Australia before Aboriginal people.” Bellear’s sacking from the Rabbitohs only served to fuel his sense of injustice. In 1970, he was part of a delegation that travelled to Atlanta to address the United Nations General Assembly. Returning to Australia, Bellear was active in the first of the “Tent Embassy” protests, in which activists set up tents opposite municipal buildings to make a stand against the government’s approach to indigenous land rights. This was summed up by one judge in a 1971 ruling: “No doctrine of common law ever required or now requires a British government to recognise land rights under Aboriginal law which may have existed prior to the 1788 occupation.” Bellear paid great attention to the apartheid struggle in South Africa and First Nations social justice issues in the US, all the while accruing intellectual ballast to bolster his case for the benefits of self-determination. He spent time with Maori communities and studied various systems for indigenous peoples, like the Sami parliament of Norway. Together with his brother Bob, who had become a judge, Bellear was instrumental in founding the Aboriginal Legal Service. He also helped to found the Aboriginal Housing Company and Aboriginal Medical Service Redfern, alongside its director, his sister LaVerne Bellear. He was deputy chair of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission, and supported last year’s Uluru Convention – a gathering of indigenous leaders whose objective is summed up in the “Statement from the heart” issued in October: “We seek constitutional reforms to empower our people and take   in our own country.” Arguably one of the most important moments in Bellear’s career as an activist came on the 10 December 1992, when he took to the stage at the Redfern Oval to introduce Prime Minister Paul Keating. Keating gave a speech that cut to the heart of the issues Bellear was fighting so hard to overcome. Keating called for recognition of the damage inflicted upon the indigenous Australians by settlers, admitting, “We took the traditional lands and smashed the traditional way of life.” Bellear said of the moment Keating started speaking, “He was a bit nervous, you know, and you could see the anguish on the faces of non-Aboriginal people ... and then the looks on the faces of Aboriginal people as he started to talk about the murders and the oppression. And you could see Aboriginal people in the park saying to each other, ‘Fuck yeah – that’s right, that’s it – he’s nailed it.’” It was a watershed moment. However, Bellear would lament almost a quarter of a century later, “how the fuck is it that the lot of my people has since improved so little?”  In 1999, Bellear was awarded Member of the Order of Australia for services to the Aboriginal community, and for his healthcare work in particular. Throughout his life, Bellear remained a keen participant and supporter of Rugby League. Dropped from the Rabbitohs for his activism in the Sixties, he returned to the team as a board member later on. He had also played for the Redfern All Blacks, revealing in a radio interview that while the Redfern All Blacks were an all-Aboriginal side, they were actually named for the colour of their socks. In 2016, he was a celebrity judge at the National Indigenous Football Championships. Like his barrister brother Bob before him, Bellear was honoured with a state funeral. On what was billed as “Sol’s last march”, more than a thousand mourners accompanied his final journey from the offices of Aboriginal Medical Services Redfern to the Redfern Oval, home of the Rabbitohs. Fellow activist and scholar Paul Coe, speaking at the funeral, summed up his friend’s philosophy: “Solly had an outlook on life. You need more than anger to change the world.” Aptly, his life was celebrated in the place where almost exactly 25 years earlier he had introduced Keating to the crowd and made history. Remembering that momentous day, Bellear once said, “It all goes back to history in this country”, later lamenting: “We don’t learn the lessons of our history.” Bellear is survived by his partner Naomi Mayers and by his children, daughter Tamara and son Joseph.

" If it sounds too interesting to be true, it probably is In the age of social media, it’s becoming harder and harder to separate fact from fiction.  And as stories go viral at the click of a button, getting shared all around the world, it becomes more difficult to verify stories and debunk them before they've been blown right out of proportion completely. From famous people doing good deeds to random facts and trivia from big names, here are some rumours that sounded too interesting to be true, This week   had to speak out after an unsubstantiated story circulated that said she helped a homeless teenage mother after seeing her begging outside a cafe. The story was shared 70,000 times within 24 hours after being posted on the Facebook page Jennifer Aniston Fans, with people writing messages such as “You are a true inspiration, Jennifer Anniston” But a spokesperson for the actress said she had nothing to do with it. Confusion arose after the fan page told a story - that had nothing to do with Anniston - and included a picture of Aniston hugging a fan (who was also not involved in any way). “The story on the fan page has nothing to do with Jennifer and we are not at all sure where it came from,” her representative told Just Jared.  One rumour that refuses to die is the recurring motif suggesting a young Marilyn Manson appeared as “the best friend” on The Wonder Years. Images circulating showed an apparent Manson with curtains and thick black spectacles, but it was actually an actor named Paul Pfeiffer, who, shock horror, actually looks nothing like Manson. Now, the joke is used as social currency to imply someone is particularly stupid:    That Marilyn Manson is that kid from The Wonder Years     had to politely step in after a photo that circulated on an unverified Facebook page suggested he went “undercover” as a homeless person but was so appalled by the lack of empathy from onlookers he started giving out $100 bills. The story was liked over a million times and had nearly 700,000 shares on Facebook. The less exciting reason he looked homeless was that… he was on the set of his film Time Out of Mind, in which he played a homeless man. Gere said the story was “somewhat fictional” but suggested he would look into ways of raising awareness and helping homeless people in future.

The actor defends the church and says it was a source of support for him when he lost his girlfriend, mother and son  A photo claiming to be posted by Meryl Streep on the actresses’ Facebook page was praised after she gave a sassy response to a director who told her she was “too ugly” for a part in King Kong. The image showed Streep riding the New York subway following an unsuccessful audition for King Kong and racked up plenty of hits due to the comment underneath, which claimed to be written by Streep herself. “I took a deep breath and said 'I'm sorry you think I'm too ugly for your film but you're just one opinion in a sea of thousands and I'm off to find a kinder tide'. Today I have 18 Academy Awards,” it said, which soon got spread across the internet. Once again, however, the page was an unverified one, and the photo and the comments were completely unrelated. Streep did audition for King Kong, where she surprised an Italian director by understanding his slur about her looks and responding on Italian - but the photo was actually taken several years later.

" The post has been shared almost 70,000 times   has quashed a viral story suggesting she helped a homeless teenage mother.  A picture of the actress with a fan, who is not homeless or in any way related to the story, was shared by an unverified Jennifer Aniston community page with 500,000 likes on Tuesday. The image was shared with a story in quote marks about someone coming to the aid of a teenage runaway with a baby and helping her return back to her parents.  The story stated at the bottom that Aniston was not the person speaking, but it was posted above a picture of her hugging a young woman, leading many to incorrectly believe that these were her quotes.  I was day tripping to Vancouver from Seattle and stopped in for lunch at a little cafe. From my window I saw a young... Fan have been rushing to praise her humanity and kindness, with one writing: “What a wonderful story Jennifer. I've always admired you as an actress but what you did was incredible; so kind and loving and generous.” Another added: “You are a true inspiration Jennifer Aniston, I've always really admired you and the work you've done. But God bless you for your wonderful kindness. We all should try and help others whenever we can.”  The post has been shared almost 70,000 times within 24 hours and a spokesperson for Aniston was forced to clarify that she was not in anyway involved in the story.  US President-elect Donald Trump and musician Kanye West pose for media at Trump Tower in Manhattan, New York City Reuters Anna Wintour apologises for criticising Donald Trump on a train.

" Higher numbers of cortical neurons mean canine companions are able to do ‘much more complex and flexible things’  are significantly brainier than  , according to a new study. While cats have around 250 million cortical neurons – brain cells linked with intelligence – dogs have some 530 million. Cortical neurons are involved with thinking, planning and other complex behaviours associated with intelligence. “How many neurons you have in your cerebral cortex, I believe, is a major determinant of your biological capabilities,” said Vanderbilt University neuroscientist Dr Suzana Herculano-Houzel, one of the study’s co-authors. Dogs of all nations Jean/Flickr Creative Commons Dogs of all nations Tammy Lo/Flickr Creative Commons Dogs of all nations Luis Del Rosario/Flickr Creative Commons Dogs of all nations Lulu Hoeller/Flickr Creative Commons Dogs of all nations Krysta/Flickr Creative Commons Dr Herculano-Houzel developed the method for accurately measuring the number of neurons in brains. “I’m 100 per cent a dog person,” admitted Dr Herculano-Houzel. That bias aside, she said these findings suggested dogs had the capacity to do “much more complex and flexible things with their lives than cats can”.  In a   published last year, neuroscientists Professor Ursula Dicke and Professor Gerhard Roth stated that the number of cortical neurons “comes to mind quite naturally” when searching for a “neurobiological basis of intelligence”. “At the least, we now have some biology that people can factor into their discussions about what’s smarter, cats or dogs,” said Dr Herculano-Houzel. The new findings emerged from a broader study,  , investigating the relative brain sizes and numbers of cortical neurons found in a range of carnivorous mammals. Besides cats and dogs, Dr Herculano-Houzel and her collaborators also measured the brains of hyenas, lions, bears, mongooses and raccoons.  Hunting requires more intelligence than grazing, so the scientists assumed they would find far higher numbers of cortical neurons compared to brain size in meat-eating mammals than found in their prey. In fact, it turns out the cortical neuron-to-brain ratio was low in larger mammals like bears. This is the same relationship between number of cortical neurons and size as is found in plant-eating mammals. A bear’s brain is 10 times the size of a cat’s, but it has about the same number of neurons. Brains require a lot of energy, and though meat provides plenty of that, the scientists concluded carnivores must strike a balance between investment in brains packed with cortical neurons and overall size. “Meat eating is largely considered a problem-solver in terms of energy, but, in retrospect, it is clear that carnivory must impose a delicate balance between how much brain and body a species can afford,” said Herculano-Houzel.

" ‘If it’s going to take my life alone to save lives of millions of people and to expose the crimes they have committed, then that’s fine’  is only 23 and yet already a number of labels have been ascribed to her. Escaped Isis sex-slave. Yazidi advocate. UN goodwill ambassador. Human rights activist. Award-winner. Survivor.  When Isis came to Kocho in northern Iraq in 2014, Murad had just passed eleventh grade and was getting ready to start the twelfth. She was 21, living with her brothers, their wives and children and her mother. Her days were spent working on a farm and attending the local school.  “This was a life of a village; a simple life,” says Murad. “This was a life away from things I am in now.” Murad has now travelled the world, given evidence before the United Nations and addressed various heads of state. But before Isis came, her whole world existed inside the village she had never left.  Displaced people from the minority Yazidi sect, fleeing violence from forces loyal to the Isis in Sinjar town, walk towards the Syrian border, on the outskirts of Sinjar mountain, near the Syrian border town of Elierbeh of Al-Hasakah Governorate    Displaced people from the minority Yazidi sect, fleeing violence from forces loyal to the Isis in Sinjar town, walk towards the Syrian border, on the outskirts of Sinjar mountain, near the Syrian border town of Elierbeh of Al-Hasakah Governorate  Displaced Iraqis from the Yazidi community settle at a camp at Derike, Syria. In the camps here, Iraqi refugees have new heroes: Syrian Kurdish fighters who battled militants to carve an escape route to tens of thousands trapped on a mountaintop  A pilot based at RAF Marham entering a Tornado GR4 prior to taking off for the reconnaissance mission over Iraq. Several RAF Tornado jets set off from RAF Marham in Norfolk this afternoon to travel to a pre-position, from where they will fly to northern Iraq to provide improved surveillance of the situation on the ground. The jets, fitted with Litening III targeting and surveillance pods, will be able to fly over the crisis area to provide intelligence and help with the delivery of humanitarian aid  A British Royal Air Force (RAF) Tornado GR4 aircraft equipped with the Litening III pod from RAF Marham, eastern England, on their arrival at RAF Akrotiri Cyprus for their reconnaissance mission over Iraq  Aid inside a Royal Air Force (RAF) Hercules C130 J aircraft before being airdropped to civilians in Iraq A Royal Air Force (RAF) Hercules C130 J military transport plane at RAF Akrotiri in Cyprus.

Thousands fled to Mount Sinjar, but militants quickly surrounded Murad’s village and those inside could not escape. Six hundred men, including her brothers, and women who were deemed too old to be sexually exploited were rounded up the day she was taken and slaughtered. Murad’s mother was among those killed.  She was part of a group of 150 women and children who were taken to the city of Mosul and then separated. Each militant took one woman. From that moment on, they began to inflict what an investigation by the Independent International Commission of Inquiry (COI) would go on to describe as “unimaginable horrors” on the women. Murad’s simple life was suddenly overcome with pain and dehumanisation. She was beaten, raped and abused by her captors every day.  “Before August 2014, we did not know there was something called human trafficking. I only heard this for the first time when they took us to Mosul and they said to me: ‘You are an enslaved captive.’” When she spoke at the United Nations Security Council and gave a full account of the barbarity the group unleashed on her, recalling how Isis militants would gang rape her until she fell unconscious, the men in the room cried.   met Murad after she delivered the keynote speech at the Trust Women Conference in London where she bravely relived her trauma, as she has done countless times, to launch a rallying cry for the world to do more to prevent the persecution of the Yazidi community. More than 5,500 Yazidis have been murdered by Isis in the two years since she was taken. At least 3,000 are still being held by the group. “Isis really changed the lives of hundreds of thousands of people, not just for me but for the women who have lost their husbands, for the children, for the 6,500 who were taken.” Softly spoken and small framed, she has summoned incomprehensible strength in order to repeat her nightmare again and again.  One of the oldest minorities in Iraq, Isis considers Yazidis heretics and has declared non-Muslim women and children to be taken and sold as slaves. A   distributed by Isis deemed it “permissible” to rape a female slave “immediately after taking possession of her” and “permissible to have intercourse with the female slave who hasn't reached puberty if she is fit for intercourse”.  After a failed attempt at escaping, Murad eventually fled via an unlocked door and, with the help of a Muslim family, made it to a refugee camp. Now she is the most powerful voice to emerge from the Yazidi community and an advocate who uses the abject horror of her own experiences to draw global attention to the crimes inflicted on her community. In October Murad was jointly awarded the Sakharov Prize, the most prestigious human rights prize in Europe. Now living in Germany, she visits refugee camps and travels around Europe to raise awareness of the brutality Isis subjects women to.   “I’ve been trying to change the world for a year, trying to show the images of humans and victims before the eyes of leaders, politicians and world leaders the tragedy in order to stand with us, so they stop terrorism and trafficking.” Murad’s fight for justice has been bolstered by the presence of Amal Clooney. The human rights lawyer stood before the UN Security Council to condemn the inaction of world leaders over the persecution of Yazidis, where those present were unprepared for what she would say. “This is the first time I have spoken in this chamber,” Clooney began. “I wish I could say I'm proud to be here but I am not.   as a supporter of the United Nations that states are failing to prevent or even punish genocide because they find that their own interests get in the way.” Not one member of Isis has been held accountable for the atrocious crimes they have committed against the Yazidi community. In no uncertain terms, Clooney told delegates that Murad and other women who have suffered so egregiously at the hands of Isis deserve to see their abusers held to account.  Murad’s fight is one Clooney takes with her when she travels, most recently using her  to call on women to take action where world leaders have not by uniting against the persecution of Yazidi women and the abuse of women worldwide.  Clooney has shone a light on the Yazidi cause, says Murad, and with that, given them a small ray of hope. “When Amal said that (she felt ashamed), thousands of people in the camps were very happy because people thought that if the world can feel ashamed then they might do something.  “She came in while the world was vastly silent about these crimes and she is an international lawyer. She is doing this for free for us and she is someone who fights for human rights. We are very lucky that she has taken on this case.”  Murad is contacted constantly by the families of captive Yazidi women desperate for help in rescuing their loved ones. Isis often asks for tens of thousands of pounds as ransom money, which many displaced families living in refugee camps simply cannot pay.  Her advocacy has made her a public figure, and this visibility comes at great personal risk. Murad recently received a message from her niece, who said when Isis see her on television they vow to capture and enslave her again.  “It is a dangerous thing to speak against them publicly, but when you see the enormity of what they have done, of their crimes, what type of tragedy they have caused... If it’s going to take my life alone to save lives of millions of people and to expose the crimes they have committed, then that’s fine. “It is not an easy thing to go and speak about the rape, the genocide, to say that you were the victim of genocide and rape. But it is something that I feel obligated to do because they are following us, attacking us with the intention to exterminate us. And if they are capable of doing that, they will do that. Unless we can end the terrorism and the ideology of terrorism, we cannot feel safe.  “Freedom is the most valuable thing that a human being can ever have. Freedom is life itself.

" 'Couples undergoing IVF and trying to improve their chances of success by reducing their exposure to environmental chemicals may want to opt for products that are flame-retardant free,' says Harvard University professor Flame-retardant chemicals used on furniture and other products could be making women infertile, a new study suggests. Researchers in the US found more than 80 per cent of women having fertility treatment at the Massachusetts General Hospital had traces of three types of chemicals known as PFRs in their urine. And those with high levels of the chemicals were 38 per cent less likely to have a child after a cycle of IVF treatment than those with low levels. While the study does not prove the chemicals are causing infertility, it highlights a possible link. One of the researchers, Dr Courtney Carignan, said: “These findings suggest that exposure to PFRs may be one of many risk factors for lower reproductive success.” “They also add to the body of evidence indicating a need to reduce the use of these flame retardants and identify safer alternatives.” And her colleague at Harvard Unviversity’s school of public health, Professor Russ Hauser, said the evidence was strong enough to make prospective parents think about trying to avoid exposure to the chemicals. “Couples undergoing IVF and trying to improve their chances of success by reducing their exposure to environmental chemicals may want to opt for products that are flame-retardant free,” he said. PFRs were introduced as flame retardants as a supposedly safer alternative to PentaBDE after evidence of its adverse health effects. However concern has been growing about PFRs – organophosphate flame retardants – which are used in polyurethane foam in upholstered furniture, baby products and gym mats, for example. They can spread from furniture into the air and dust of rooms.

Writing in Nature, an international team of researchers described how they had taken pieces of cancer’s genetic RNA code, put them into tiny nanoparticles of fat and then injected the mixture into the bloodstreams of three patients in the advanced stages of the disease. The patients' immune systems responded by producing killer T-cells designed to attack cancer. The vaccine was also found to be effective in fighting “aggressively growing” tumours in mice, according to researchers, who were led by Professor Ugur Sahin from Johannes Gutenberg University in Germany Rex A compound found in green tea could improve the cognitive abilities of those with Down’s syndrome, a team of scientists has discovered. Researchers found epigallocatechin gallate – which is especially present in green tea but can also be found in white and black teas – combined with cognitive stimulation, improved visual memory and led to more adaptive behaviour. Dr Rafael de la Torre, who led the year-long clinical trial along with Dr Mara Dierrssen, said: “The results suggest that individuals who received treatment with the green tea compound, together with the cognitive stimulation protocol, had better scores in their cognitive capacities” Taking antidepressants during pregnancy could almost double the risk of a child being diagnosed with autism in the first years of life, a major study of nearly 150,000 pregnancies has suggested.

 PA This adds to something of a cocktail of hormone-disrupting chemicals in modern houses, a problem that can be exacerbated by a lack of effective ventilation. Pesticides and phthalates, which are used to make plastic more flexible in a whole host of products, have also been linked with reproductive problems. Commenting on the new study, Professor Richard Anderson, an expert in clinical reproductive science at Edinburgh University, said: “There is growing concern that the chemicals we are all exposed to may have an impact on fertility, but direct evidence of impact in men and women has often been limited.  “This carefully conducted study analysed chemicals from flame retardants in urine from women having IVF, and found that the chemicals were detected in most women.   “Worryingly, higher concentrations of these chemicals were associated with substantial reductions in the success of IVF, with a lower chance of having a baby.” He said this method of studying the effects of chemicals on fertility was a good one.   “Studying couples having IVF is a powerful way of carrying out analyses such as this, as it allows each of the steps in conception and pregnancy to be examined, which isn’t possible in natural conception,” he said. “While this study doesn’t prove that these chemicals are the cause of the lower success rate, it provides a firm basis for further experiments to investigate them.  “It also provides strong support for the need to regulate our exposure to chemicals and test their potential impact on fertility.” Professor Allan Pacey, of Sheffield University, said the data obtained by the Harvard researchers “seems fairly convincing” and supported the idea of “a link between a woman’s exposure to these flame-retardant chemicals and her chances of getting pregnant”.  Journalist Carrie Gracie speaks to the media outside the BBC in London after she turned down a £45,000 rise, describing the offer as a botched solution to the problem of unequal pay at the BBC.

" Survivors calling for public inquiry into sexual and physical abuse during Thatcherite 'short, sharp shock' policy Hundreds of boys say they were subjected to sexual and physical abuse amounting to “torture” in youth detention centres, sparking calls for a public inquiry. A lawyer representing the alleged victims said they had been raped, beaten and sexually assaulted during the 1970s and 1980s. David Greenwood, the head of child abuse at Switalskis Solicitors, said he was already representing more than 400 men and being “approached constantly” by new claimants. “Clients I’ve spoken to have said it was like torture – they were locked up and couldn’t get away,” he told  “Most of them say it made them anti-authority, they felt as though they couldn’t trust people. “For boys in for stealing to be subjected to this indiscriminate violence was a shock, and I say it was unlawful. “It made boys who had obviously done wrong in some respect into boys who were worse, and ended up in violence.” Former inmates at Eastwood Park Detention Centre in Gloucestershire have told Mr Greenwood they were punched if they did not answer officers’ responses with “Sir”. Others described being regularly hit “for the slightest misdemeanour”, being whipped with rubber pipes, forced to perform extreme exercise, have cold showers and were made to crouch in stress positions without chairs. Noel Smith, who was imprisoned in a detention centre aged 15 after stealing a motorbike, said his three-month ordeal in 1976 drove his descent into more serious offences including bank robbery. The 57-year-old recalled being punched to the floor by one officer while still at court, then smacked on the other side of his head by another, even before being taken to the institution. “When we arrived we had to run the gauntlet past the screws,” he added. “We were kicked, punched and had our ears pulled. Someone poked their finger in my eye. “Once we were inside, we were stripped and stood in the reception naked while everybody went about their business around us and staff made disparaging remarks. It frightened the life out of us.” Mr Smith said there were “beatings from start to finish” of his imprisonment, seeing guards drag inmates out of their chairs by their sideburns and grab them by the scrotum while smiling. Now an author and commissioning editor of  , a prisoners’ newspaper, Mr Smith said: “It made me bitter and twisted, it was one humiliation after another. “It turned us into hardened criminals. I went in for stealing a motorbike, and six months later I was appearing in court for armed robbery and possession of firearms... common sense should have told you then that brutalising kids would have an adverse effect.” Police are already investigating allegations relating to Medomsley Detention Centre in County Durham and Kirklevington Detention Centre in North Yorkshire, where more than 400 victims have already come forward. But Mr Greenwood said the scale of abuse is “most definitely wider”.  “It was an institutional problem that seemed to have been taking place at all these detention centres at that time,” he added.  When asked what kind of sexual assaults his clients told him took place in the centres, Mr Greenwood listed them as “rape, indecent assault and oral sex”. Some of the alleged abuse has been attributed to policies brought in by Margaret Thatcher’s government, including Home Secretary Willie Whitelaw’s ‘short, sharp shock’ initiative. The policy saw young offenders detained in secure units and subjected to quasi-military discipline, despite the fact there was no evidence it would deter them from reoffending.

We need an inquiry to work out who was authorising this type of behaviour.” Professor David Wilson, a criminologist who was governor of a progressive young offenders’ institution in the 1980s, said detention centres were run to deliberately put inmates under psychological and physical stress. “That line between putting someone under stress and simply brutalising them seemed to never be clearly enough drawn,” he added. “The ‘short, sharp shock’ was clearly going to be interpreted by some members of staff in ways that would lead to abuse.” Victims are calling for a new public inquiry to be opened into the treatment of young male convicts at all detention centres in Britain. HM Prison and Probation Service (HMPPS) claimed the allegations would be covered by the ongoing Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse, but critics argue its remit is not wide enough to fully address the new allegations. Mr Greenwood argued the current inquiry does not specifically address physical abuse, and its scope is also limited by ongoing criminal proceedings. “We’re hoping that the Home Secretary will look at this again and think about a proper public inquiry,” he added. A HMPPS spokesperson said: “There is already an inquiry looking into these allegations, which is part of the Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse. “The allegations of abuse by former members of staff at Medomsley Detention Centre are subject to an ongoing police investigation, therefore it would be inappropriate to comment further.” We use cookies to enhance your visit to our site and to bring you advertisements that might interest you.

" Police say 'significant loss of life' was averted with arrests in December 2016 An  -supporting couple have been found guilty of preparing to launch a terror attack using a homemade bomb and chemical weapons in the UK. Security services feared Munir Mohammed and Rowaida el-Hassan were ready to strike before they were detained in December 2016, with police saying a “significant loss of life” had been averted. Mohammed, 36, had already amassed two out of three core components for triacetone triperoxide (TATP),  , including in Paris and Brussels. He had also downloaded manuals on how to make mobile phone detonators and ricin, a deadly poison that can kill an adult victim with just a few grains. Mohammed, of Leopold Street in Derby, and El-Hassan, of Willesden Lane in north-west London, denied preparing terrorist acts between November 2015 and December 2016 but a jury found them both guilty.  Judge Michael Topolski QC remanded them in custody and warned them they faced jail when they are sentenced next month. He said Mohammed had been convicted of “planning a potentially devastating terrorist attack by creating an explosive device and deploying it somewhere in the UK targeting those you regarded as enemies of Isis”. “Rowaida El-Hassan, you share the extremist mindset with Munir Mohammed and you were ideologically motivated to provide him with support, motivation and assistance,” the judge added. “You knew he was engaging and planning an attack. You knew he was planning an explosion to kill and maim innocent people in the cause of Isis.” The Old Bailey heard that El-Hassan, a pharmacist, became a willing participant in the plot after meeting Mohammed on dating website SingleMuslim.com. She had advertised “for a simple, very simple, honest and straightforward man who fears Allah” who she could “vibe with on a spiritual and intellectual level”. Prosecutors said Mohammed was specifically drawn to her profile in late 2015 after seeing she had a masters’ degree in pharmacy, aiming to use her chemical knowledge in the attack. Jurors were told the pair had a “rapidly formed emotional attachment and a shared ideology” and were in regular contact on WhatsApp by spring 2016, meeting in a London park near El-Hassan’s home. Records of their messages show they shared extremist views and videos, while Mohammed was put in touch with a man he believed was an Isis commander via Facebook. Prosecutor Anne Whyte QC said Mohammed “resolved upon a lone wolf attack”, while working making sauces for supermarket ready meals, and El-Hassan was well aware of his plan. He pledged allegiance to the man, known as Abubakr Kurdi, and offered to participate in “a new job in the UK” – a phrase jurors were told referred to a terror attack. In September 2016, Mohammed complained he had not received his instructions, telling his contact: “If possible send how we make dough [explosives] for Syrian bread [a bomb] and other types of food.” El-Hassan, a 33-year-old divorcee with two children, advised Mohammed on what chemicals to buy for a bomb, the court heard. That November, Mohammed got hold of a video containing information on how to manufacture ricin, and days before his arrest he was captured on CCTV buying “acetone free” nail polish from Asda, in the mistaken belief it was a component of TATP. He also looked at pressure cookers at Ace Discounts, which the prosecution said could be used to contain the  Police found hydrogen peroxide in a wardrobe and hydrochloric acid in the freezer of his home during a raid on 12 December 2016 but Mohammed claimed they were for domestic purposes. He told the Old Bailey he sent El-Hassan extremist videos “mainly for the news” and claimed his intention was “to marry her”. But Mohammed had an arranged marriage in Sudan with a woman he had never met called Fatima, who he was hoping to bring to England on a student visa. He had arrived in Britain in the back of a lorry and claimed asylum in February 2014, the court heard. After awaiting a decision for more than two years, he appealed to his local MP Margaret Beckett for help, but she was told his case had been referred to a “specialist unit for consideration”. El-Hassan, who came to Britain from Sudan at the age of three, told jurors she had sulphuric acid for her drains and got face masks to wear as she dealt with a damp problem in her flat.

Yes, there was emotional attachment. “There were feelings developing and we were getting to know each other. I was grateful for things he helped me with. And he was grateful for things I helped him with. I liked the attention he was giving me.” Police said it could not be proven that El-Hassan was an extremist before she met Mohammed, but could have been in no doubt about his jihadi beliefs. Detective Chief Inspector Paul Greenwood, who led the investigation, said the website they used was a “normal place to look for a relationship”. But Mohammed used it to get advice on where to source chemicals to manufacture TATP from El-Hassan, who was previously unknown to the security services. “Munir shared with her some really graphic and brutal execution videos, lots of other ideological material, including children executing Isis prisoners and children involved in military training in the name of the Islamic State,” DCI Greenwood said. “She appeared to be very receptive to that and they seemed to encourage each other with their shared mindsets... irrespective of whether she was influenced by him, she knew fully his mindset and contributed to a set of circumstances that, had we not intervened, could have resulted in significant loss of life in the UK in the lead-up to Christmas 2016.” Sue Hemming, the head of of the Crown Prosecution Service’s counter-terror division, said the couple were “clearly attracted to each other through their support for Daesh’s violent ideology and its intolerance of those who do not subscribe to its views”. “They planned to kill and injure innocent people in the UK and had the mindset, the methodology and almost all the material needed, for Mohammed to carry out an attack,“ she added. “Both will be in prison, where they cannot plot together and will no longer be a danger to the public.” We use cookies to enhance your visit to our site and to bring you advertisements that might interest you.

" Damning reports into death of Katrina O'Hara result in new national guidance for domestic abuse cases A man who told officials he wanted to kill his ex-girlfriend and had a history of domestic abuse was freed from police custody days before he carried out his violent intentions, a review has found. Two damning reports into events leading up to the murder of Katrina O’Hara found police, mental health services and local authorities had “sufficient knowledge, opportunity and legal means” to stop her attacker but failed to recognise the risk he posed. In the 58 days between the grandmother’s first call to police and her death, officers were repeatedly told how Stuart Thomas was stalking and harassing her, even threatening to crash a car and kill them both. But investigators classed Ms O’Hara, 44, as the attacker in one incident and were manipulated by Thomas as he sought revenge for her attempts to end their extra-marital relationship. When police decided to seriously investigate her allegations they seized her mobile phone, leaving her “afraid, vulnerable” and without means of calling 999 while outside her home in the days leading up to her murder. Two of the officers involved in the case were found guilty of misconduct by disciplinary panels, but remain in their jobs after being given a written warning and “management advice”. Ms O’Hara’s three children said her death must “serve as a wake-up call to the Government and police forces across the country”. “Our mother’s death could have been prevented, and this only makes our grief even harder to bear,” said Kyle Stark, 27, Dean Stark, 25, and 18-year-old Morgan O’Hara in a joint statement. “Our faith in policing has been shaken to the core, and of course we’re disappointed that Dorset Police haven’t taken stronger action against the officers involved, but we’re speaking out not to criticise the police but to call for change in how all police forces and other agencies handle domestic abuse.  “We’re victims of police cuts. Every force needs to have the funding to be able to deliver the right training to all officers and support staff, and to then assess how effective that training actually is – otherwise there will be more avoidable deaths.” Findings by a local watchdog in Dorset and the  (IOPC) have sparked a change in the national guidance for police. All forces are being asked to ensure domestic abuse victims are provided with replacement phones if theirs are seized for investigations  The IOPC also called on Dorset Police to clarify their procedure for breaches of bail conditions, to improve training for call handlers, and ensure domestic violence victims have the means to contact police and relatives. Graham Beesley, an operations manager at the watchdog, said: “On a number of occasions when Ms O’Hara’s contacted Dorset Police, officers failed to take appropriate action in a timely manner and did not take her specific needs and vulnerabilities into account.  “We also found instances where police did not properly consider the seriousness of non-violent risk factors, including the escalating nature of the incidents between Ms O’Hara and Thomas in the months leading up to her murder.” An acting sergeant was formally disciplined for failing to investigate Ms O’Hara’s report that Thomas had been harassing her, and for failing to put in protective measures. A detective constable was served a written warning for failing to arrest Thomas for breaking his bail conditions days before he stabbed his victim to death at her hairdressing salon, and a detective inspector and police constable will be disciplined for unsatisfactory performance.  Ms O’Hara met Thomas while working at her salon in Blandford Forum, Jock’s Barbers, and they became romantically involved in May 2015. When Thomas, a father-of-four, failed to leave his wife as promised two months later, Ms O’Hara attempted to end the relationship and his behaviour became increasingly controlling and violent. She did not know that he was already subject to a five-year restraining order imposed the year before to stop him contacting another woman he had an affair with. In a pattern that would repeat, he had responded angrily to her attempts to end their relationship, turning up at her home and workplace, abusing her verbally and via text, physically assaulting her and blackmailing the woman by falsely accusing her of stealing from employers. Ms O’Hara’s first call about Thomas was on 10 November 2015, when he slapped her and repeatedly threw her on to a concrete floor during an argument at an industrial unit where he worked. “The investigating officer initially recorded that Ms O’Hara was the victim in the incident,” the IOPC report states, describing how Ms O’Hara had thrown his possessions during an argument.  “However, after Mr Thomas showed the police some CCTV footage, the investigating officer decided she was the suspect and Mr Thomas was the victim.” At around the same time, Thomas started making threats to kill himself, sending suicidal messages to friends and Ms O’Hara, who reported harassment to police again on 16 and 17 November. Police were supposed to visit the grandmother’s home on 20 November but they never arrived because the officer who viewed Thomas’s CCTV footage decided to view her reports as “linked counter-allegations” and closed the investigation – a decision reviewers called a “critical failure”. The couple briefly reconciled until an argument on Christmas Eve, when Thomas attacked Ms O’Hara with a hairbrush, before pleading her to take him back at her home the next day. On Boxing Day, the grandmother awoke to find him standing at the end of her bed after climbing in through an open window – the second time he had broken in. Fearing for her teenage daughter’s safety, she persuaded Thomas to give her a lift to collect her car but he instead started driving at dangerous speeds down country lanes “threatening to crash and kill them both”.  Thomas snatched Ms O’Hara’s phone when she attempted to call the police, and she only escaped by pretending she needed the toilet and fleeing through a field. On 27 December, Thomas was hospitalised after an apparent suicide attempt, after which he continued to bombard Ms O’Hara with text messages including pictures of nooses and threats to kill himself, causing the victim and her daughter to call police over the next two days. Her son contacted police to seek help on 30 December, when checks finally brought together the catalogue of previous incidents and resulted in Thomas being arrested on suspicion of stalking and harassment.  But he “minimised his behaviour” and was granted police bail late the same day on the condition he had no direct or indirect contact with Ms O’Hara, whose phone was seized for the investigation. While in custody Thomas told a liaison nurse he wanted to “kill his girlfriend” but the official concluded that he “posed a low risk to himself, others and the general public”. Ms O’Hara was not told of his release or the terms until she contacted police – who were unable to reach her because she had no mobile phone – for an update on 1 January, as one of Thomas’s relatives texted her daughter to make her drop her witness statement. The clear violation of bail conditions should have resulted in enforcement action by police but it did not and Thomas remained free, continuing to harass his victim and her family.

The watchdog said the police’s subsequent failure to arrest Thomas for breaching his bail conditions “emboldened him further”, adding: “The failures should not have happened… a number of agencies had sufficient knowledge, opportunity and legal means to take action to reduce the likelihood of the fatal attack.” Thomas, 49, was found guilty of murder in July 2016 and jailed for life with a minimum term of 26 years.

" Police fear they are only currently dealing with 'tip of iceberg' Victims of   in  are being   where they face a life of  , campaigners warned today. They spoke out as a joint investigation by  found tens of thousands of girls and women in the capital are hidden victims of such abuse. Police admit they are dealing with the “tip of the iceberg” and politicians stand accused of ignoring the issue over fears of being called racist. One of the most common examples of “honour-based” abuse (HBA) is forced marriage, with victims often suffering the conditions of slavery through domestic servitude. Other examples include female genital mutilation and “honour killings”. Police data obtained by   shows that in the 12 months to June there were 495 reported victims of HBA in London. Two were aged under one, three were a year old and nine were under 10. Jasvinder Sanghera set up Karma Nirvana, a charity for HBA victims, in 2008 after escaping a forced marriage by running away from home aged 16. Since then it has received more than 58,000 calls. She said “thousands upon thousands” of girls in London were at risk and were being prevented from “embracing British rights, values and democracy”. Women were often forced to marry to be “used as slaves” with those that had escaped describing their marriage as “a sentence”. She added: “If a girl is not conforming the family will make a decision by marrying her off or killing her. The worst insult they can use is you are behaving like a white woman – they have bigoted, racist views and there is no counter-narrative. They are being radicalised. “There is fear of being called a racist, fear of treading on cultural toes. British girls are being failed by Britain. The scale is huge, frightening. There are many communities who think like this.” Karma Nirvana provides training to the police, NHS and social services. Ms Sanghera also acts as an expert witness and lobbies government. On one occasion a police officer rang the helpline to ask whether it was an acceptable part of someone’s culture for a 26-year-old man to be sleeping with a 12-year-old girl, she said. The reaction from schools was also “damning”, with not enough being done to identify potential victims. “They don’t want to offend communities. They don’t want to rock the boat,” she added. “There is no statutory duty to report HBA. There is no will to make this part of the  inspection framework despite our request and numerous representations to ministers.” A   report last month revealed there were only 215 prosecutions for honour-based violence and forced marriage in Britain in the past year. One relative of a murdered HBA victim told how she was “failed” by the authorities. Sarbjit Athwal, of Hounslow, helped to jail mother-in-law Bachan Athwal for arranging the murder of Surjit, 27, Bachan’s daughter-in-law. The Old Bailey heard Surjit was taken in 1998 to a wedding in India where Bachan arranged for her to be drugged, strangled and thrown into a river. She believed Surjit had brought shame on the family by starting an affair. The body was never found. In 2007 Bachan, 70, of Hayes, and her son Sukhdave, 43, were both jailed for life. Sarbjit, 47, who became a key witness, feared she would suffer the same fate as Surjit. She said: “I lived in a family who believe ‘honour’ was beyond everything and anything. My sister-in-law was murdered. I tried to alert the authorities but they failed me. “It took three investigations before I was believed. Too many people are getting away with it because police, agencies and authorities do not understand how to protect victims.” Commander Parm Sandhu, the   lead on HBA, said: “The problem we have is it is unreported. Very, very few individuals come forward. Victims tend to still live with parents. Young brothers and sisters will be punished if they do not toe the line.” She said there was “self-policing” in communities. “Victims are targeted because their perceived behaviour is considered shameful. They might be seen with a boy, or wear Western clothing. [Community members] will mention it to the parents. It is not just the older generation. We know it is far more that the figures we have got.” Crime minister Sarah Newton insisted the Government would not allow “political or cultural sensitivities” to obstruct action: “We are working with communities through our FGM and forced marriage units to ensure victims have confidence to come forward.” Journalist Carrie Gracie speaks to the media outside the BBC in London after she turned down a £45,000 rise, describing the offer as a botched solution to the problem of unequal pay at the BBC.

Jameel Muhktar, 37, suffered serious burns to his head and body after the   in Beckton, east London, on 21 June. His cousin  , 21, was also left severely injured after the perpetrator threw a corrosive substance through the windows of the car they were travelling in. “I feel like it’s destroyed my life,” Mr Muhktar told  . “I’m still in severe pain. I can’t move my head left to right. I’m deaf in one ear. I can hardly walk. I’ve had all sorts of skin grafts.” He said he had ended up living in a bedsit alone and had suffered a breakdown because of the   he had endured. “I don’t think they (the  ) understand about these attacks,” he said, adding that he wanted counselling. Ms Khan has blogged about her experience and recovery online, as well as the lasting impact the attack left on her in the months afterwards. “Today I was too petrified to walk to my local shop,” she wrote in July. “Too scared to face the world. Too scared of the looks I might get. “Too scared to tackle the question ‘how are you’. Just too scared. That’s all I’ve been. Terrified and reluctant.

" Maria Quinn told she couldn't use temporary ramp as she wasn't in a wheelchair Disability campaigners have called on the Government to end “humiliating” benefit assessments after a disabled woman was forced to “crawl” up stairs to attend an appointment. Maria Quinn, who is partially sighted and walks with the aid of a wheeled frame, described how she was left feeling “mortified and panicked” after finding there was no step-free access for her consultation at a disability benefits centre. With her solicitor carrying her mobility aid and her sister holding her breathing equipment, Ms Quinn, 32, managed to enter the building on Glasgow’s Cadogan Street by “crawling up the two split-level stairs”. She said she was refused the portable ramp which can be used to cover the entrance stairs as it was intended for wheelchairs only, and if she had returned to her flat to collect her chair she would have been late and missed the appointment. “There is no ramp or flat entrance to the disability assessment building…that’s right folks! You read it correctly,” Ms Quinn wrote on Facebook “I am partially sighted and stairs aren’t my best buds at the best of times but these are ye olde ultra solid not-concrete-but-possibly-some-sort of-titanium-killer-stairs…you know the ones! Crumbly ends from centuries of feet and furniture and goodness knows what.” Campaigners at disability charity Scope said her case highlighted the difficulties disabled people face in trying to attend assessments, and called for an overhaul of how they are carried out. James Taylor, Scope’s head of policy, said disabled people were suffering “unnecessary anxiety or distress” because of the way benefits assessments were being handled.   He told   the Government must “adopt a more flexible approach in how it carries out Personal Independence Payment assessments for disabled people in these situations and ensure assessment centres provide accessible options for disabled people”. “No one should be forced to drag themselves up a staircase in order to attend their benefits appointment – to subject anyone to this level of humiliation is simply deplorable, he added. “We’ve heard too many stories of disabled people who are caused unnecessary anxiety or distress when attending benefits assessments – being forced to travel unreasonable distances for their appointments or struggling to access the centres themselves. “Disabled people we speak to often tell us that a face-to-face assessment is not always the best method of assessment, due to accessibility.” A spokesman for the Department for Work and Pensions said: Where an assessment centre isn’t directly accessible from the street level, we endeavour to make this clear to people before they arrive for their appointment. “There is a ramp available at the Glasgow Assessment Centre - if people can’t use this, arrangements will be made to see them at an alternative location.

" Retaining partial membership of the EU would allow UK nationals to travel and work freely inside the bloc Britons could be offered “associate citizenship” of the European Union after   even if   blocks the plan, the MEP who drafted the proposal has said. “ ” remains a “realistic” ambition and Brussels should make it available to UK nationals even if the British Government vetoes the plan during negotiations, Charles Goerens said. Commenting in the wake of the Government’s  , he said he was increasingly hopeful that his proposal would be offered to the UK once it quits the bloc.  In November,     that a plan for “associate citizenship”, proposed by Mr Goerens, was being considered by the European Parliament. It would allow UK nationals who applied for EU citizenship to work anywhere inside the union as well as giving them a vote in European Parliament elections – while retaining their British passport. The Luxembourg MEP said there was no real opposition to the policy from his fellow lawmakers in Brussels and Strasbourg, who will be given the final say on the Brexit deal in a vote at the European parliament.  And he said the EU’s negotiators should make it a red line in future discussions, adding that eventual treaty change was in the interests of those on both sides of the Channel. The proposal has offered hope to   from Europe and the opportunities it provides. Ms May outlined the Government’s negotiating position in a speech at Lancaster House in January, followed last week by a Government White Paper. Mr Goerens said the Prime Minister’s remarks were “very positive” and showed she understood there was a “real problem” for Britons living both in the UK and Europe.  “Theresa May’s proposal is a step in the right direction,” he told   in a phone interview from Brussels.  “The White paper was a clear signal that I was not totally unrealistic by launching the idea of European ‘associate citizenship’. “It is for technical reasons that she wasn't more outspoken on this issue. “She sent a clear signal that she has understood that there is a real problem. Let’s not be too pessimistic about that.

It is up to us to move the lines, we are not only the observers, we are the actors. “The European Parliament will have the last say on the arrangement between the European Commission and the UK, we have a good opportunity to make clear our views on what should be the outcome of this process, and one of the outcomes is the status of people most negatively affected by Brexit.” Opposition to the plan may come in the form of hard-line Eurosceptics, who claim associate membership of the EU would dilute Brexit and create a two-tier system that would undermine British citizenship.  Those concerns may be enough to convince Ms May to veto the proposal from Mr Goerens and his colleagues in the European Parliament.  But the MEP said 'associate citizenship' should be offered to Britons regardless of any reciprocal offer or concession made by the UK. He said: “Even if there were no move made in this direction by the United Kingdom, in my view we should even unilaterally offer the European associate citizenship to UK citizens because it would be in everybody’s interest to act in this way.  “It is still achievable because once Brexit is concluded people will be stripped of all their rights linked to European citizenship. We must launch this process in a pragmatic way, but why should it not be practical?” We use cookies to enhance your visit to our site and to bring you advertisements that might interest you.

" Start-up donations spurred on by Independent article earlier this year Britain’s first cat café could be open within months after members of the public donated more than £100,000 to bring the Japanese idea to the UK. The café – which will be staffed by between 10 and 15 felines – was overwhelmed with start-up donations after an article in   about entrepreneur Lauren Pears’ idea. Today she revealed that she is now looking at prospective sites in the Old Street area of London with a view to opening in May – and has already found the café’s cat stars. Cat cafés are already popular in Japan, where dozens of establishments cater for people whose small apartments preclude owning a pet. Guests pay a fee to stroke the animals while they drink coffee. Ms Pears, 30, who describes herself as “chief crazy cat lady”, spotted a gap in the market in Britain. With landlords none too keen on tenants keeping animals in rented accommodation, and with increased financial pressures meaning not everyone can afford the food and veterinary care necessary to look after a pet, Ms Pears quickly found thousands of supporters for her fledgling business. She has received more than 300 job applications and a further15 are sent in every day. The money trickled in slowly, but after the article in   at the beginning of this year, donations via her page on the crowd-funding website Indiegogo escalated. Promising visits to the café for £5,  and offering VIP membership for £130, she accrued a fund of £25,000 by 11 February. Two weeks later, the total stands at £109,510. Of the 30 available £500 cat-sponsorship packages, 20 have been claimed. The cats will be rescue animals from the Mayhew Animal Home in Kensal Green, north-west London, and Ms Pears claimed their welfare was at the forefront of her mind. “We tried to figure out a solution where the cats don’t get too stressed out which is why we’ve introduced the cover charge,” she said. “That way, people can stay as long as they like without feeling like they’re against the clock which works for the cats because it takes cats a little time to get used to people.” But not all cat lovers are convinced. The animal welfare campaigner Celia Hammond said that she “wasn’t comfortable” with the idea of using cats in this type of venture. “The cats would be happier with a family and a home, rather than a changing group of people,” she said, claiming she was worried that any cats who stray on to the road “wouldn’t last very long”. “What would happen if there was a fire or if somebody broke in?” Ms Pears responded: “We’re going to have a volunteer programme so people who can’t afford the cover charge can actually come in overnight and look after the cats.” We use cookies to enhance your visit to our site and to bring you advertisements that might interest you.

" Victim raises concern over courts' sentencing powers as consultation on new acid laws continues  A 17-year-old boy has pleaded guilty to launching a spate of   in attempts to steal mopeds in London. Derryck John, who previously could not be named because of his age, doused in a rampage through London on 13 July. One of his victims was left with life-changing injuries and others bear long-term mental and physical scars from their ordeal. John, from Croydon, managed to steal two of the six mopeds he targeted from their owners before being arrested at 3am the following morning. He pleaded guilty to six counts of throwing a corrosive liquid with intent to “disable, burn, maim, disfigure or cause grievous bodily harm”, two counts of robbery and four counts of attempted robbery at Wood Green Crown Court. The defendant originally denied the charges and had been due to stand trial, but changed his plea on the first day of the hearing. An indictment lists another unidentified person, who is believed to have been on the same moped as the defendant, as involved in the attacks. In a note read to the court by judge Noel Lucas QC, John said the guilty pleas were entered “on the basis that the acid was thrown to incapacitate the victims” and that “the other male involved was much older than me”. “I really didn't appreciate the damage that would be done,” the boy added. “I'm terrified of the sentence that I will receive and I'm very sorry for what I did and realise I will receive a significant sentence of imprisonment.” Reporting restrictions had banned John's identity being released because of his age until Monday's hearing. But Judge Lucas told the court there was an overwhelming, huge public interest in naming the teenager following his guilty pleas. The substance used is thought to have had a PH of one or two – making it the strongest acid available – the court heard. John did not enter a plea on a further charge of robbery on 25 June and his mother sobbed and shouted as she left court. His first victim was Jabed Hussain, who was working for UberEats at the time and credits his “melted” helmet for deflecting the acid and saving his life. He told  he was concerned that the courts’ powers will be insufficient to punish the 17-year-old when he is sentenced on 9 March. “I just want to see the time in prison he gets,” Mr Hussain added. “A lot of these criminals are under 18 so are we going to let them do whatever they want to? That makes me angry.” The guilty plea came a day after the Government announced major retailers had signed a voluntary commitment to stop selling corrosive products to under-18s in shops or online. But Mr Hussain claimed attackers will seek other ways of obtaining the substances, adding: “They’ll get it from the kitchen, they’re going to get it from the garage. They will try something else. “I don’t know what the Government are doing. They are cutting a lot of police, there are long waits for ambulances and for doctors…I think acid attacks are getting worse now.” Mr Hussain has been unable to return to work since the attack, where he sustained damage to his lungs by accidentally inhaling water tainted with acid as his face was rinsed off. He joined hundreds of delivery drivers protesting to demand improved safety measures earlier this year and has met with MPs and police on the issue. Mr Hussain is calling for more high-visibility police patrols and a boost in frontline policing, as officer numbers remain at their lowest level since 1985 despite a 13 per cent rise in recorded crime.

Assistant Chief Constable Rachel Kearton, its lead on corrosive attacks, revealed last month that the UK now has   – and the number is rising. “It appears that in 2017 we will again exceed previous records for the number of attacks [but] I strongly feel that this is an under-reported crime at this time,” she said at the time. Investigators have warned corrosive substances are being used as an alternative weapon by gang members and robbers, who have also used them on pedestrians to steal phones. But delivery drivers are being overwhelmingly targeted by assailants attempting to steal their scooters, who have also deployed weapons including knives and hammers. The Government has responded by proposing stricter controls on the sale of acid and a law making it illegal to carry the fluid in a public place without a good reason. But the consultations on new laws, including on increasing sentences by classifying acid as a “dangerous weapon”, have just finished and the measures have not yet come into effect. Police are currently carrying out a survey of attacks across England and Wales, with the results due in February, and the Home Office has commissioned separate research seeing convicted attackers interviewed to learn more about their motivations.

" Local authorities urge new figures  inquires The number of investigations into child abuse and neglect started by local authorities has soared by 60 per cent in the last decade, as councils warn children's services are reaching tipping point. LGA ore than 500 child protection inquiries began each day last year, compared to around 200 a day 10 years ago. The findings indicate that a growing number of children in England and Wales are being referred to children’s social care services because of concerns over domestic violence, parental mental health, neglect and physical abuse. Council leaders say there are a number of reasons for the rise, including increased public awareness and reporting of potential abuse, the impact of poverty and deprivation on families and a lack of funding to help families early on before problems escalate. But they warn that children’s services — which the LGA says face  Cllr LGA “With councils now starting 500 child protection investigations each day, along with providing the other vital services that they deliver, children’s services have now reached a tipping point. This has to be wake up call to government that unless there is an injection of funding to support crucial early intervention services, many more vulnerable children and families will need formal support from council child protection services in the years to come.” It comes after   that as many as 140,000 vulnerable children at risk of abuse and neglect were not getting adequate help because local authorities had been forced to shrink or abandon family support. The figures, obtained by charity Action for Children, showed that in 2015-16, 184,500 children’s needs assessments were closed as “no further action” as they did not meet the threshold for statutory services.  This prompted concerns that opportunities to “act early” and protect youngsters from further harm were being missed because councils did not have the capacity to intervene. Neglect was the most common initial category of abuse for children who were the subject of a child protection plan last year, accounting for almost half (48 per cent). This was followed by emotional abuse, which accounted for more than a third (34 per cent), the government figures show. Responding to the latest figures, Eleanor Briggs, head of policy and research at Action for Children, said funding cuts had forced local councils to “shrink or abandon” children’s services designed to help families before problems escalate.  “It’s no surprise therefore that more and more children, young people and families are being referred to social services; even then many of them are not getting the help they need, she added. “After they are assessed and then closed to social care, the needs of this group of vulnerable children would historically have been met by early help services such as children’s centres or domestic violence programmes – but as these services have been reduced or closed, many now no longer receive any support.  “The status quo simply cannot continue – the Government must address the funding gap for children’s services if we’re are going to step in help children before they reach crisis point.”  Journalist Carrie Gracie speaks to the media outside the BBC in London after she turned down a £45,000 rise, describing the offer as a botched solution to the problem of unequal pay at the BBC.

" ‘Devastating’ rise in reports of parents telling their children they hate them or wish they were dead The number of children being reported as victims of emotional abuse has soared by 200 per cent in seven years, more than any other form of child abuse, according to new figures released by the NSPCC. Helpline staff have heard accounts of parents telling their children they hate them or wished they were dead, threatening them with extreme violence and blaming them for issues they are facing themselves such as unemployment or financial problems, the charity warned. New figures published in the NSPCC’s  report show the number of calls made to the charity’s helpline about children being subjected to emotional abuse increased from 3,341 in 2009/10 to 10,009 in 2016/17. Last year alone (2016/17), the NSPCC’s child protection experts dealt with 10,009 contacts relating to emotional abuse – the equivalent to 27 a day – with three quarters deemed so severe they were referred to the police or children’s services. The full scale of the problem could be much greater and is demanding that the Government commissions a nationwide study that looks at the prevalence of child abuse and neglect in the UK, the NSPCC warns. It is unclear how many more children in the UK are suffering from emotional abuse, or any other form of maltreatment, it adds, because of a lack of research in to the extent of abuse.  The last study of this kind took place in 2009, and the charity warns that since then there have been significant changes for children’s lives, not least the increase in reporting of online abuse and big increases in reporting of child sexual abuse.   Helpline practitioners identified common themes raised by callers concerned that a child was being emotionally abused included domestic violence, alcohol or substance abuse and mental health issues. Ongoing emotional abuse can make children feel worthless and unloved and can have a profound effect on a child’s development, which can lead to issues in later life, such as depression, anxiety, eating disorders, substance misuse and suicidal feelings, the NSPCC said. The figures come amid growing concern over cuts to child protection services in local councils, which the Local Government Association (LGA) has warned is leading to “increasingly scarce resources” to deliver “crucial services” for children. Responding to the figures, Cllr Richard Watts, Chair of the LGA’s Children and Young People Board, said: “The dramatic rise in the number of children reporting emotional abuse is extremely concerning.  “Councils have worked hard to protect funding for child protection services, but ongoing cuts to local authority budgets are forcing many areas to make extremely difficult decisions about how to allocate increasingly scarce resources. “Pressure on children’s services is growing rapidly. In the last 10 years alone we have witnessed a 140 per cent increase in child protection enquiries and a funding gap of £2bn is projected by 2020.  “Councils have responded to this funding crisis by reducing costs and finding new ways to deliver services. But there are very few savings left to find without having a real and lasting impact upon crucial services many children and families rely on.” Journalist Carrie Gracie speaks to the media outside the BBC in London after she turned down a £45,000 rise, describing the offer as a botched solution to the problem of unequal pay at the BBC.

" Report shows staff shortages mean many young offenders locked in cells for 23 hours a day, with some prevented from showering daily Children are being locked up for almost entire days in youth prisons, with some prevented from showering every day, a watchdog has warned. eepening staff shortages in jails mean many 12 to 18-year-olds are being locked in their cells for nearly 24 hours a day, with increasingly poor access to showers and telephones. And although the numbers who had felt unsafe in young offender institutions (YOIs) has fallen from a record high level in 2015–16, the survey found that almost 40 per cent of inmates still feel unsafe. Campaigners have said the findings demonstrate that children in custody are being treated worse than animals, describing the treatment as “appalling” and warning that “children are being harmed”. Inspectors also flagged up how, across both types of custody, there were disproportionate numbers of black and minority ethnic children, and children from Gypsy, Romany or Traveller communities, compared to their representation in the general population. Children with disabilities and mental and emotional health problems, and with backgrounds in local authority care, were also held in high numbers. Publishing the analysis of the experiences of young people held in the youth custody estate, Chief Inspector of Prisons Peter Clarke said there was an “urgent need” for an “effective operational response” to the issues raised.  “The need for this to be the case has actually increased, particularly when it comes to improving both the perceptions and the reality of safety, he said. Until this is addressed, the broader objectives of delivering education, training and creating a rehabilitative environment will not be achieved. HM Inspectorate of Prisons (HMIP) compiled the report from questionnaires completed by youngsters detained at secure training centres (STCs) and young offender institutions (YOIs) in England and Wales between the start of April 2016 and the end of March this year. Staffing issues at both STCs and YOIs had a ”detrimental impact“ on the daily regime for all children, according to the watchdog. The report says: ”We have found far too many boys being locked in their cells for more than 22 hours each day, with staff struggling to manage the complexities of regimes where some boys can only be allowed out of their cells while others are locked up.“ Put simply, in some places, on some days, there were too few staff to enable boys and girls to have the range of daily activity they should have had or, for example, to ensure daily access to showers and telephones, the assessment adds. Responding to the findings, Frances Crook, chief executive of the Howard League for Penal Reform, said: “Once again, this annual report presents an appalling picture. Children are being harmed. “The Howard League is representing children who have been held in solitary confinement for long periods of time. Boys hardly ever see daylight, have a very poor diet, get little or no help with their problems, and even getting a shower is a challenge. If we treated animals like this, it would be a national scandal.  “The inspectorate is right to draw attention to the disproportionate numbers of black and minority ethnic children, and children who have been in care, in custody. It raises serious questions about the sentencing and remand decisions of the youth courts.”  Minister for Youth Justice, Philip Lee, said: “More young people feel safer in custody than the same period last year, but current safety levels are still unacceptable and I have been clear there is much more to do.

" Watchdog warns of 'significant waste of resources' as teenagers at Cookham Wood miss 40 per cent of classes due to staff shortages while teachers and therapists 'wait in empty rooms' Children in prison are being denied access to education and therapy because they are locked in their cells while skilled and enthusiastic professionals wait for them in empty rooms, the prisons watchdog has warned. Difficulties getting 15-18-year-old boys at Cookham Wood young offender institution (YOI) out of cells to attend the wide range of group-based services available due to staff shortages led to a “significant waste of resources”, a report by HM Inspectorate of Prisons (HMIP) said. Between April and June 2017, 40 per cent of planned groups had been cancelled due to the “poor regime and delays in movements”, which left professionals waited in empty rooms for boys to arrive, according to the report. While the report notes that once boys were at education the provision was “good” and the curriculum met the needs of learners, it states that time out of cell was inadequate and regime curtailments and unlock procedures hindered access to important services and support.  It adds: “Leadership and management of learning, skills and work required improvement. Attendance was poor. Punctuality had improved but was still not good enough.” The prison told the inspectorate that, on average, boys spent about 19-and-a-half hours a day locked inside their cells – and inspectors said that a significant number of boys were locked up for even longer. Inspectors also found the prison had become less safe and more violent since the previous inspection in 2016, with “little evidence of an effective strategy to reduce violence”. One in four boys reported having felt unsafe – a figure which had more than doubled since the last inspection. Levels of violence and incidents of self-harm, two of the key indicators of safety, had increased. Some serious incidents of violence also went without punishment due to the amount of adjudication hearings that were not proceeded with, the report said. Peter Clarke, HM Chief Inspector of Prisons said while he didn’t underestimate the risks presented by some of the boys at the establishment, some of the unlock procedures were “unnecessarily cumbersome and created further delays to an already curtailed regime”. “The main prison regime was also poor and unpredictable. The lack of time out of cell restricted access to education, interventions and meaningful interaction with staff and other boys, Mr Clarke added.  “What was perhaps most unforgivable was that there were many skilled staff and partners who were keen to work with boys to help them progress but their efforts were frustrated by the failure to unlock boys on time, if at all. We were told by numerous professionals that this was not uncommon.” In light of the findings, campaigners said the regime was “damaging” children and accused the Government presiding over a “deepening crisis” in the imprisonment of young offenders by failing to act on repeated warnings. Richard Burgon MP, Shadow Secretary of State for Justice,  described the report as being “yet another shocking report into a failing system”, adding: “It is a national scandal that children in custody are being held in unsafe conditions where levels of violence and self-harm are not only high but increasing. “We cannot turn young offenders' lives around if we can’t even keep them safe or get them out of their cells for long enough to get to classes. Last year the Chief Inspector found that not a single young offender institution inspected was deemed safe.  “This report shows the Government is not only failing to turn this around, but it is presiding over a deepening crisis.” The Howard League for Penal Reform said the advice line for children and young people in custody received more than 100 enquiries in the last year either from or on behalf of children in Cookham Wood, including a 15-year-old boy with significant mental health problems who was locked in his cell all day on Christmas Day and allowed only one exercise session between Christmas Eve and New Year’s Day. The charity's legal team which runs the advice line have also been made aware of children being unable to get clean clothes, and that a significant number of children had been held in conditions of solitary confinement, denied access to education and gym. Howard League research has found that more than 1,000 days of additional imprisonment were imposed on children in Cookham Wood following disciplinary hearings, known as adjudications, in 2016 – a 35 per cent rise from the previous year.  Frances Crook, Chief Executive of the Howard League, said: “No child is safe in Cookham Wood prison. Violence is rife. Staff are resorting to draconian punishments. It is shocking that boys as young as 15 are being held in such conditions.  “I visited the prison myself less than two weeks ago, and I was very disappointed to find boys were being locked up all day. Unsurprisingly, the inspectors found the same – teenagers with nothing to do, staring at bare walls for days on end. “When I visited, the quality of the food was awful. Children were being given a very impoverished diet, so they were supplementing it by buying sweets and biscuits. This is a prison regime that lacks affection and kindness and imagination and skill. It is damaging children.” Overall, Mr Clarke said: “A new governor had been appointed just weeks before our visit. We were encouraged by his optimism and plans to address the issues we have highlighted in our report. Cookham Wood retains many redeeming features, not least an extended team of enthusiastic staff with a wide range of skills.  “They now need to focus on ensuring that boys can access the services they need to progress.” Journalist Carrie Gracie speaks to the media outside the BBC in London after she turned down a £45,000 rise, describing the offer as a botched solution to the problem of unequal pay at the BBC.

" The Christmas Eve rush is frenzied enough without ending up at closed stores It's Christmas Eve: the beginning of the Christmas celebrations, full of family, friends, fun and food – and frantic rushing to the shop. If you're taking part in that final, frenzied shopping then you're going to want to make sure that the shop will actually be open when you get there. Thankfully, most supermarkets are, though not all. Of course, this year Christmas Eve also falls on a Sunday. That means that shops might shut earlier than they usually do on the 24th – but it also makes it slightly simpler, since most are keeping to their normal Sunday trading hours. (If the shop you're looking for isn't listed below, and you can't find details, the safest assumption is probably to use its Sunday opening and closing times.) ‘We’re excited to be giving Tate Britain a whole new face this Christmas,’ says the gallery’s director Alamy Live News.

" Battersea Dogs and Cats Home notes a rise in abandoned huskies and malamutes Breeds that have become the latest craze often end up on Battersea’s doorstep when their new owner realises the reality of what they have taken on. In recent years, the home has seen a number of huskies and malamutes arrive after   superfans realised the issues around owning a real-life “direwolf”. In 2010, a total of 53 huskies and malamutes came through the doors, but by 2013 as the show became more popular the number had doubled to 116. Both breeds need a huge amount of exercise and hate being left alone for long periods, making them unsuited for city living. So far this year, 74 huskies and malamutes have been brought in, and   attributes the drop to an education campaign to get people to think twice before buying the dogs. Equally, the fashion for flat-faced breeds like French bulldogs and pugs, which often have extensive health problems, has seen a jump in these breeds arriving at Battersea. Alice Christie, a spokeswoman for the home, says: “We tell people to imagine breathing through a drinking straw – that’s what it’s like for these breeds their airways are so narrow. “Often the people who bring them in aren’t irresponsible owners, they just can’t afford the vet bills.” Despite years of campaigning to persuade Britons to think twice about giving dogs or cats as gifts – summed up in the Dogs Trust’s slogan “A dog is for life, not just for Christmas” – staff know that they will still see an influx of dogs in a few months’ time when their novelty wears off. Rehoming and welfare manager Becky Fisher says: “Around March we do have more dogs gifted in to us or come in as strays. “Although we don’t know, we do think that might be dogs and cats that people have got as Christmas presents, and especially when they’re quite young and they would have been a puppy or a kitten around Christmas time.

" Transgender people will also be able to choose their legal sex more easily as part of shake-up announced by Education Secretary Justine Greening Gay men will be allowed to donate blood three months after having sex rather than a year, under equalities reforms announced by the Government. Transgender people will also be able to choose their legal sex more easily as part of the shake-up announced by Education Secretary Justine Greening. Fears over infections being passed on through donations from gay men led to an outright ban at the height of the Aids epidemic, but that was cut to 12 months in 2011. The new guidelines, which campaign groups have been calling for, are in line with improved NHS testing measures, which can establish whether someone has a blood infection such as HIV, hepatitis B, hepatitis C or syphilis within three months. LGBT rights activists, who want to get rid of the blanket deferral period entirely, have hailed the shift in policy as a major step towards a fair and equal system. Ms Greening, who is also equalities minister, said the Government was building on the progress on tackling prejudice made in the 50 years since the partial decriminalisation of homosexuality. “This Government is committed to building an inclusive society that works for everyone, no matter what their gender or sexuality and today we’re taking the next step forward,” she said. “We will build on the significant progress we have made over the past 50 years, tackling some of the historic prejudices that still persist in our laws and giving LGBT people a real say on the issues affecting them.” Reforms making it easier for transgender people to choose their sex legally by removing the need for a medical diagnosis of gender dysphoria and speeding up the bureaucratic process will be consulted on in the autumn. Ms Greening said she wanted to cut the stigma faced by trans people, who have to provide evidence that they have been in transition for at least two years before they can apply to legally change their gender. It comes after Prime Minister Theresa May earlier this week indicated she was preparing to reform the Gender Recognition Act, saying that “when it comes to rights and protections for trans people, there is still a long way to go”. Suzanna Hopwood, a member of the Stonewall trans advisory group, said: “Reform is one of the key priorities in our vision for removing the huge inequalities that trans people face in the UK. The current system is demeaning and broken. “It’s vital that this reform removes the requirements for medical evidence and an intrusive interview panel, and finally allows all trans people to have their gender legally recognised through a simple administrative process. That’s what we’ll be calling for during this consultation, and I’m looking forward to seeing the law change soon after. The Government accepted the recommendations of the advisory committee on the safety of blood, tissues and organs (SaBTO) on changing the deferral periods for blood donations from gay men. Russia’s antipathy towards homosexuality has been well established following the efforts of human rights campaigners. However, while it is legal to be homosexual, LGBT couples are offered no protections from discrimination. They are also actively discriminated against by a 2013 law criminalising LGBT “propaganda” allowing the arrest of numerous Russian LGBT activists.

(Picture: Purported Isis fighters in Iraq.)  Ethan Spibey, founder of the FreedomToDonate group that has campaigned for reform, said: Today’s announcement from the Government marks a world-leading blood donation policy for gay and bisexual men and the other groups previously restricted.  “I’m so proud that the work of FreedomToDonate and our supporters will help ensure more people than ever before are allowed to safely donate blood. “I began this campaign because I wanted to repay the donor who saved my granddad’s life after a major operation and this announcement means I’m closer than ever to doing that, with the invaluable help of our team of volunteers, and the charities and organisations FreedomToDonate represents.”  Ruth Hunt, Chief Executive of Stonewall, said the changes were “welcome” but that it was merely a “stepping stone” on the path to a more inclusive system. “Changes to the blood donation rules are welcome. However, while this is an important move, it’s vital that this is a stepping stone to a system that doesn’t automatically exclude most gay and bi men,” she said. “We would like to see individualised risk assessment, and are encouraged that the Government and NHS Blood and Transplant Service are committed to exploring how to do this.” Stewart McDonald MP, who co-chairs the all party parliamentary group on blood donation that led on the Parliamentary Inquiry said: “I am delighted at this monumental change in blood donation policy, which will ensure more people than ever before can donate blood and increase blood stock whilst always maintaining its safety and integrity.

" Crews’ efforts to halt the spread of the Kensington blaze were hampered by a series of equipment failings on the night  (LFB) are in the process of buying aerial ladders that may have been able to reach the upper floors of   Tower. Appliances currently held as part of the service’s stock of equipment only reach up to 32m – at least 30m short of the higher floors of the 24-storey block that was ravaged by fire in 2016.  The new higher ladders will allow the service to mitigate a “wider operational risk base”, according to LFB safety director, Steve Apter, speaking on behalf of fire commissioner Dany Cotton. Mr Apter said he hoped to procure equipment that could reach up to 22 or 23 floors high. Only two people from the 23rd storey of the block – the top floor – survived. At least 48 others from floors 19, 20, 21, 22 and 23 died.  Crews’ efforts to halt the spread of the   blaze, which claimed 71 lives, were reportedly hampered by a series of equipment failings on the night. A high ladder, which could have reached the 10th floor, was not dispatched until 24 minutes after emergency services arrived on scene, according to an incident mobilisation list seen by the BBC, which experts said could have allowed the service to contain the fire if it had arrived earlier.  LFB confirmed after the tragedy a high ladder will now automatically be sent to a fire in a tower. Mr Apter said the decision to bring in new equipment was informed by lessons taken from the tragedy and from “understanding and knowing risk”.  “Those extended height appliances have a far wider range of operational use, from rescue platforms to firefighting platforms, observation platforms, they can lift. So it’s a really wide ranging use of equipment and they would give us a wider resilience for a wider operational risk base,” he said at a mayoral budget scrutiny meeting at City Hall.  “Some of the ones we are currently looking at can reach up to 22 or 23 floors in a high-rise so they are considerably extended in their capabilities than currently.” Mr Apter said the time frame for the procurement process was still unclear but he hoped to have acquired the new equipment by the end of 2018/19 or early 2019/20.

The existing operational fleet consists of four TLs and seven ALPs, plus four ALPs used as reserve appliances. Turntable ladders have a reach of 32 metres. Aerial ladder platforms have a reach of 30 metres.  A spokesperson for the service said the plans would see five new appliances added to the brigade’s stock of 15.  “In March 2017 the brigade announced plans to upgrade and replace its existing fleet of 15 aerial appliances. In July, as part of a review into the brigade’s resources requested by the Mayor, the Commissioner said it would be beneficial to incorporate up to five extended height aerial appliances into that fleet of 15,” a spokesperson said.  “Exactly which aerial appliance the brigade would benefit from is still being reviewed. The final decision will take into account the range of crucial tasks aerial ladders perform at incidents which include providing high level lighting, for use as observation platforms and as a way of delivering water from height onto a fire. It should be noted that fires in high rise buildings are usually fought internally which is why the building’s fire safety measures are so crucial and why the longest ladders available are rarely the most effective way of responding. Rescues from fires in high rise premises are almost always undertaken by firefighters working within the building.” It comes some weeks after an   delivered a damning indictment of the UK’s building regulations. Dame Judith Hackitt, the chair of the independent review, said the law was “not fit for purpose” and allowed contractors to abuse the system. The causes of the fire in West London will be determined by a public inquiry that is currently underway, but fire safety experts widely condemned the tower’s single staircase design and the lack of sprinklers in the building in the fire’s aftermath.  Combustible plastic foam insulation and cut-price aluminium panels with a polyethylene core fitted to the block have also been blamed for the rapid spread of the fire.  The Government said it accepts all of the report’s recommendations.

" Speaking exclusively to The Independent, Elizabeth Campbell says safety is 'under legal remit' of Kensington and Chelsea tenant management organisation The leader of Kensington and Chelsea Council (RBKC) admitted she is unable to rule out the possibility of another catastrophic fire in the borough, four months on from the   disaster.   said fire safety must be of “very high consideration” in the wake of the blaze that killed at least 80 people in north Kensington. But the Conservative leader said residents’ safety was not the council’s responsibility while housing remained under control of the Kensington and Chelsea tenant management organisation (TMO), the group in charge of the block that went up in flames in June.  Speaking exclusively to  , Ms Campbell said fire safety would be the council’s “top priority” if the TMO agreed to make RBKC its sole member.  The   in September and had called to be appointed its majority stakeholder, in effect disbanding the company. But survivors fiercely opposed the decision, fearing it would allow the TMO to escape possible criminal charges and civil proceedings.  Police investigating the fire announced there were “reasonable grounds” to suspect both  . A meeting to decide the group’s fate has been postponed for 21 days but the delay exposes the accountability vacuum facing occupants of the nearly 10,000 properties in the borough managed by the TMO. “Am I going to tell you hand on heart I don’t think there could be a fire in any of our properties? I couldn’t possibly say that. What we have to do is be sure there are good fire safety regulations in place,” Ms Campbell said. “It’s not for me to be reassured or not reassured, the TMO is responsible for it.” When asked whether tower-block residents had expressed concerns over fire safety, she added: “Of course, whether they are in tower blocks or not in tower blocks, everyone is sort of looking over their shoulders now like everyone else round the country.” Former council leader   amid accusations the council had ignored a catalogue of warnings before the disaster. Ms Campbell’s subsequent appointment was mired by negative press after she admitted  , days after stepping in to lead the response effort to the deadliest tower block fire in modern history. Four months on, she hit back at the “ridiculous”, “lazy” media coverage, telling her critics to “judge me by what I’m doing and not by where I live”. “I was quite inexperienced at the time and I remember thinking, ‘I’ve been in a tower but not up a tower, does that count?’,” she said.  “We have children’s homes in towers, we had a youth group in a tower, so does that mean if I haven’t been to the 21st floor I don’t care? I just think that’s ridiculous. Of course I care. What does it say that I haven’t been to the 21st floor? I don’t know? I’ll ask you? Do you think it matters nowadays?” She paused, before adding: “It is symbolic, isn’t it?

sticking point surrounded her £1m second home on the Isle of Wight that was originally purchased through a family trust and a company registered to an offshore tax haven. “Look, I am what I am, I can’t pretend I’m not,” she said. “I reject the fact that people think I’m out of touch – I don’t think I’m out of touch. But on the other hand have I shared that same experience? No I haven’t.” Ms Campbell, who is a councillor for the affluent Royal Hospital ward covering Sloane Square and the Kings Road, has repeatedly refused to question the council’s conduct prior to her appointment, telling  : “I apologised, I didn’t criticise. I think you will have to wait for the public inquiry.” But she did strike a conciliatory tone, speaking at length about the ongoing trauma facing survivors and what she hoped to do to help them, while remaining characteristically tight-lipped on how the tragedy had affected her personally. She accepted the borough faces an uphill challenge to rebuild community trust, but said she hoped her actions would show she is sincere. “I wouldn’t be in this job if I didn’t think it was possible,” she said. “You can’t just say to people, ‘well, it’s been absolutely terrible’ and shrug your shoulders.” Despite the backlash, she said she was the right person for the job, touting her experience working in family and children’s services “dealing with some of the most disadvantaged families in north Kensington ... on the ground.” When asked how she handled being confronted with such unimaginable horror, she said: “I met a mother last week who said we don’t want to sleep, because they don’t know what the night will bring. This isn’t about me, it’s about them.” She said seeing people “in pieces” made her “ever more determined” to help, adding: “It doesn’t help me sleep better or not better at night, that’s my job that’s what I want to do, to get there and improve things.” But she accepted too many families are still living in hotels.  The current housing allocation system gives priority to certain survivors, including bereaved households or those with disabilities or young children.  But it means at least 92 households have not had the opportunity to bid for housing, despite Theresa May promising all survivors would be rehoused within three weeks of the fire.  Ms Campbell defended the delay, saying it was crucial that survivors were not rushed, adding: “It’s terribly important, I think, that it’s fair.” “It’s been absolutely awful and for people who were on the phone to people, it’s beyond imagining. And yet we’re expecting people like that to say ‘yes, I like that flat I’ll move in next week, I’ll have Peter Jones furniture and not something else furniture’,” she said.  “We really, really, really want them to move on and to have their own front door and begin the journey – it’s going to be a long journey for people to recover.

" Experts believe bomber made mistake in manufacture that meant device failed to fully explode The bomb that   contained the same powerful explosive used in the 7/7 attacks and deadly bombings across Europe, it has emerged. Ben Wallace, the security minister, confirmed the homemade device contained triacetone triperoxide (TATP), known as the “mother of Satan”. The moniker is earned by the instability of the explosive, which can be ignited by heat, friction, static or even movement, causing the deaths of several would-be bombers. “The [Parsons Green bomb] used the type of explosive similar to that used in Manchester [but] it didn’t go off,” Mr Wallace told BBC Radio 4’s  programme.  “We are trying to track down who did it, whether it’s a bomber or bombers…there’s potentially a very dangerous individual or individuals out there and we need to track them down.” Salman Abedi, the Manchester Arena bomber,  , while the explosive has been found   across Europe. TATP, which can be made in under a day using chemicals widely available on the high street, has become a hallmark of Isis attacks including those in Paris and Brussels. The group claimed responsibility for attempted bombing in Parsons Green with a statement saying it was carried out by soldiers of the caliphate. Mr Wallace said work was ongoing to prevent people buying the necessary ingredients and accessing bomb-making manuals distributed by terrorist groups online. The Terrorism Referral Unit has taken down more than 250,000 pieces of extremist information down, he said, adding: “There is definitely more to be done.  “We take a lot down but sometimes these things reappear and we go at them again.”   was able to access the bomb-making manual believed to have been used for the device in Parsons Green – as well as the Boston bombings and other massacres - in under five minutes on Saturday morning. Experts believe the device planted on the District Line in Friday morning’s rush hour used TATP and a “crude” delay timer but failed to fully explode. Commuters described a “fireball” bursting from the device and a strong chemical smell, with wires and fairy lights seen trailing from a bucket filled with a thick white liquid. At least 29 people were injured in the blast, but investigators believe the toll would have been far worse if the TATP had detonated as intended. Major General Chip Chapman, the former head of counter-terrorism at the Ministry of Defence, the shockwave effect from a full explosion could have been deadly, while the subsequent blast effect could have killed more. “This absolutely didn't function properly because...one ounce of TATP is enough to blow car doors off,” he added. An explosion on a packed Tube train has injured a number of people in west London  The blast triggered a stampede as commuters panicked  Click through for more pictures from the scene REUTERS REUTERS A bucket with flames and wires coming out of it was photographed in the carriage after the explosion – apparently the source of the blast  PA REUTERS REUTERS  Reuters   REUTERS REUTERS          David Videcette, a former counter-terrorism detective in the Metropolitan Police, said an initial fireball is normally intended to set off the main charge of explosives. “What often happens with people who try to make bombs is they don’t test the main charge and the initiator together,” he told “They know they work individually, but the difficulty comes with the chain reaction.” In a similar incident at Brussels Central Station in June, a suitcase bomb packed with nails burst into flames but did not explode, while Stockholm attacker who killed five people with a lorry in April was burned by a failed device. In October, a homemade bomb made using an al-Qaeda manual failed to detonate on a Jubilee Line train at North Greenwich Tube station. Then in May, a man was found guilty of building a bomb using fairy lights and a pressure cooker with the intention of targeting a railway line in the Midlands. Recently Isis has issued advice on how to make bombs using the explosive TATP and incendiary devices, while calling for indiscriminate attacks in countries including that UK that are targeting its militants in Syria and Iraq. The explosive has been favoured by terrorists because of the ease with which ingredients can be obtained and its ability to evade some explosives detectors because it does not contain nitrates. TATP was used by the al-Qaeda supporters who massacred 56 people in the London bombings on 7 July 2005, and more recently by Isis in the November 2015 Paris attacks, March 2016 Brussels attacks and bombings across Iraq and Syria. The Isis cell that carried out last month’s attacks in Spain had manufactured a quantity of the explosive and   but accidentally blew up their stock along with 120 gas canisters at a hideout in Alcanar. The blast killed militants and forced others to carry out a “rudimentary” version of their original plans using vehicles and knives the following day. Dr Sidney Alford, an explosives engineer, previously told  making a lethal quantity of TATP could take just 24 hours. “It’s simple,” he added. “It takes only about a couple of hours to make, then you need to filter it and wash it and dry it.  “How long it takes to dry depends on your facilities but in a normal house with a radiator or something to stand it on, you could leave it overnight.” Police have arrested one suspect, an 18-year-old man detained in Dover, over the attempted bombing in Parsons Green but suggested others remain at large. The terror threat level remains at critical after being raised overnight, meaning further attacks are considered “imminent”, and armed police and soldiers have been deployed to sensitive sites.

" An investigation by The Independent found more than 1,000 boys in the borough are currently missing from registered schools A central London council has been warned it risks another Rotherham sexual abuse scandal if it does not deal with the thousands of children thought to be taught at illegal schools. Hackney Council is at the centre of a child protection scandal after an   in the borough are currently missing from registered schools and are instead thought to be educated in illegal ultra-Orthodox Jewish yeshivas. At a meeting of Hackney Council's Children and Young People Scrutiny Board, which is holding an inquiry into unregistered Jewish schools, Chair Councillor Christopher Kennedy said: We worried there might be another Rotherham situation in Hackney if we didn't take action when we were told there were all these missing children on the school register. His comments came as religious leaders told Hackney council they felt being pressured to teach a particular agenda by Ofsted. Jospeh Stauber, headteacher of the registered Talmud Torah Yetev Lev primary school for children in Hackney, warned councillors: Don't try to tell us what to learn with the children when it's against our religion. That's why we keep on hiding.    Hackney is home to a large ultra-Orthodox Jewish Charedi community, which is regarded as insular and practices a strict 19th-century interpretation of the faith. Engagement with the secular world is for many deeply taboo and boys over the age of 13 are expected to learn the Old Testament in Yeshivas where they are taught in Yiddish rather than go to secondary schools and gain GCSEs. One former pupil at an illegal school in Hackney told   they went to extreme lengths to stop him learning English. Education is all about preparing people to make their own choices. The very ethos of these schools is to do the exact opposite and to isolate people from secular society, he said.  The huge risks facing children attending unregistered schools were further outlined by evidence from Rory MacCallum, Senior Professional Advisor to the City and Hackney Safeguarding Children Board. Mr MacCallum said paedophiles were present in every community which is why teachers need to be vetted and subject to regulation, adding: I can sit here and reel off a list of names of loads of individuals in positions of trust who have subsequently been found out as having a deviant sexual interest in children. That is worst-case scenario. That type of stuff happens everywhere. Speaking after the committee to  , Mr MacCallum denied that the Charedi community was complacent about child abuse but said some individuals could do more. I'm not getting the sense that the whole community is complacent. As with every other community there will be people there who are complacent, and there will be people who aren't. As well as sexual abuse, children in unregistered schools identified by Hackney council are at risk from physical harm, with Hackney London Fire Brigade Commander Steve Dudeney telling the committee there had been fires at five of 32 suspected illegal schools identified by the council, a figure he described as high. Separately, the fire brigade found evidence children may be sleeping at three of the illegal schools.  But after being presented with evidence from Mr MacCallum, Rabbi Judah Baumgarten of the Union of Orthodox Hebrew congregations said safeguarding would be enacted if Jewish schools were not told to teach a particular curriculum by Ofsted.  If safeguarding was a standalone requirement I don't think we would have a problem.  He added: Any safeguarding is as important and maybe even possibly -- I venture to say -- more important than other communities. The Rabbi was told by Hackney Councillor Margaret Gordon: Any organisation before the question of regulation of education comes up ought to be taking the issues of child protection seriously and ought to be happy to demonstrate that. To say 'we're not prepared to do that while it's linked to Ofsted' is disingenuous. We use cookies to enhance your visit to our site and to bring you advertisements that might interest you.

" Eight staff treated by paramedics after attempt to rescue animals An aardvark has died and four meerkats are missing after a fire at  . Eight zoo workers have been treated by paramedics after a desperate attempt to save the animals from the blaze, which  . One staff member was taken to hospital and seven others were treated at the scene for smoke inhalation and shock.  A nine-year-old aardvark named Misha has been found dead, the zoo confirmed, adding it was “devastated” by what had happened. The aardvark and the missing meerkats were kept in the  , a children’s zoo where the fire began. The area also houses goats, sheep, donkeys, llamas, alpacas, and pigs. The fire began at about 6am and spread to a gift shop and cafe. “We have keepers living on site and they, along with our security team, responded incredibly quickly to move animals to safe locations within their enclosures,” said a zoo spokeswoman. “Those staff who were first on the scene have been treated on site for shock and smoke inhalation. “Sadly our vets have confirmed the death of our nine-year-old aardvark, Misha. There are also four meerkats still unaccounted for, but we are now presuming these have also died. “All other animals in the vicinity are being monitored closely by our vets, but early signs suggest they have not been affected. We will continue to monitor them over the coming days.” The spokeswoman added: “We are all naturally devastated by this, but are immensely grateful to the fire brigade, who reacted quickly to the situation to bring the fire under control. “ , the aardvark who died in the fire (PA) London Ambulance Service said it treated six people for smoke inhalation and two for minor injuries. One was taken to a north-west London hospital.  Seventy-two firefighters with 10 engines battled for more than three hours to bring the blaze under control and prevent it spreading to other animal enclosures.  About three-quarters of the cafe and shop and half of its roof were ablaze. Pictures from the scene showed firefighters hosing down roaring flames as smoke billowed from the building.  The blaze was under control by 9.16am. The zoo spokeswoman added: “It’s too soon to speculate on the cause of the fire but we will be working very closely with fire investigators over the coming days and weeks to ascertain the cause. The zoo will be closed for the day and fire crews will remain on site for some time damping down.” The zoo will reopen on Christmas Eve, she added.  station manager Clive Robinson said: “The fire mainly affected the cafe and shop. Part of nearby animal petting area was also affected although at this stage we don’t know if any animals were involved.  “Firefighters worked hard to bring the fire under control as quickly as possible and to stop it from spreading to neighbouring animal enclosures. “Crews will remain at the scene throughout the morning damping down any remaining pockets of fire.” The zoo is usually open every day of the year except 25 December and had been expected to be busy on the weekend before Christmas. The attraction houses 20,166 animals, according to its inventory for 2017. It is the world’s oldest scientific zoo, dating back to 1826.

" Britain is 'out of step with a growing international consensus that children should never be placed in solitary confinement', according to the Howard League for Penal Reform A teenage boy was locked alone in his cell for 23-and-a-half hours a day during his time in a young offenders institution, a court has heard, prompting campaigners to warn that the solitary confinement of children in the UK is a “widespread concern”. The 16-year-old spent time in conditions amounting to solitary confinement for “almost the entirety of his time” at Feltham young offender institution in west London, being permitted no contact with any other child and allowed out only to shower, use the phone or exercise alone, accompanied by two officers, for 30 minutes a day, his lawyer told a judge in London on Tuesday. Dan Squires QC said the treatment of the teenage boy, who cannot be named for legal reasons, was not the result of “unique problems he poses”, but “reflects the routine practice” of Feltham in response to the many children there “whose behaviour is regarded as difficult”.  Mr Squires said: “It is widely recognised by a series of different international and domestic bodies that the prolonged solitary confinement of children constitutes cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment and should be absolutely prohibited.” Frances Crook, chief executive of the Howard League for Penal Reform, which brought on the judicial review action on behalf of the child, said before the hearing: “This is a widespread problem and it is getting worse. In just the last week, several more children, held in prisons across the country, have asked the Howard League for help because they are in almost total isolation. Some of the children we have represented have been in solitary confinement for up to nine months and have been subject to very similar regimes to the boy in this case. They have been allowed out of their cells for about 30 minutes a day, with little or no access to education, limited access to exercise or fresh air, and no association or meaningful intervention.” The Howard League has said the UK is “out of step with a growing international consensus that children should never be placed in solitary confinement”. The hearing, which continues on Wednesday, comes days after a report by the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture (CPT)   that British young offenders had suffered “inhuman and degrading treatment” due to being locked up for nearly 24 hours at a time, in breach of the European Convention on Human Rights.

" Juveniles placed on 'separation' lists spending up to 23.5 hours a day locked up in what amounts to 'inhuman and degrading treatment', warns European Committee for the Prevention of Torture British young offenders have suffered “inhuman and degrading treatment” due to being locked up for nearly 24 hours at a time, in breach of the European Convention on Human Rights, a damning new report has warned. Published by the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture (CPT), which is part of the 47-nation Council of Europe, the report raised “deep concerns” about violence, overcrowding and solitary confinement in both Young Offenders Institutions (YOIs) and adult prisons. It found that on occasion juveniles were being held in conditions akin to solitary confinement for up to 80 days for reasons of discipline and good order, while others were regularly held for 30 days or as long as 60 days. At Cookham Wood Young Offender Institution (YOI) in Kent, which was visited by the CPT, the report said juveniles were spending on average only five hours out of their cells. Some were placed on “separation” lists — denoted by vivid pink stickers of “do not unlock” on their cell doors. It said they could spend up to 23.5 hours a day locked up alone. The Committee warned that such conditions amount to “inhuman and degrading” treatment, which is prohibited under the European Convention on Human Rights. One juvenile cited in the report who had a “do not unlock” sign on his door spent all day lying on his bed under his covers, blankly looking at a TV screen, talking to and meeting no one. Another inmate, aged 15, had been held in such conditions for several weeks, and had no information about how much longer he would be held under such a restricted regime. CPT Vice President Mark Kelly told  that during the visit to Cookham Wood they found that youngsters were being banned from taking part in education and activities, and were instead spending all day locked in their rooms, apart from half an hour of exercise, with only a TV for company. “This points to the very impoverished regimes that young people have in a lot of the prisons. There were just over 40 juveniles in Cookham Wood who for various reasons were not taking part in education or activities of any kind, and they actually had pink signs on their door saying ‘do not unlock’, he said. “If you had one of these signs, it meant that you wouldn’t be allowed out at all except half an hour for a period of exercise, which you’d take on your own, and for meal times, for which you were accompanied by staff to pick up your food and then you would eat it on your own in your cell. So effectively you were locked up for 23 and a half hours a day with just a TV for company. Mr Kelly added: “What we were seeing in practice was solitary confinement. That’s effectively the regime they were in. And the CPT’s view, as the relevant treaty body, is that to keep juvenile inmates in conditions of that nature amounts to inhuman and degrading treatment.” Figures also showed a similar situation in other YOIs, with a considerable number of prisoners spending up to 22 hours per day locked up in their cells, with many inmates stating that the long lock-up times contributed to a sense of frustration. The committee recommended that the YOI Rules in the UK must be amended to reflect the “increasing trend” at the international level to promote the abolition of solitary confinement as a disciplinary sanction in respect of juveniles, and to ensure that inmates attend education and purposeful activities on a daily basis. It comes two months after an   by  earlier this year found that British prisons were holding child inmates in solitary confinement in an alleged breach of UN torture rules and British law.  More than a dozen examples were uncovered in the investigation, including a teenage prisoner with a serious mental health condition who, it was claimed, was placed in solitary confinement inside a number of different British jails during a period of six months, causing him considerable distress and psychological damage. The CPT report also warned of an “alarmingly  high” number of recorded violent incidents at all prisons, both adult and juvenile, it visited, and said that none of the establishments visited could be considered safe for prisoners or staff. Injuries to both prisoners and staff included cases of scalding water being thrown over victims and ‘shank’ (make-shift knife) wounds, head  wounds, broken  noses  and  broken  teeth. Inmates frequently required  hospitalisation and, in one case, resulted in death. The CPT cited a lack of trust in the staff’s ability to maintain prisoner safety and recommended that a “far  greater  investment” in preventing violence must be undertaken. Alarmingly, the report stated that these figures under-record the actual number of incidents and consequently fail to afford a true picture of the severity of the situation. It urged that “concrete measures” must be taken to bring prisons back under the effective control of staff, reversing the recent trends of escalating violence. Over the last 25 years, the prison population has nearly doubled, and almost all adult prisons now operate at or near full operational capacity and well above their certified normal capacity. Due to  nationwide  budgetary  cuts, the number of front-line officers in English  prisons  has meanwhile dropped by some 30 per cent over three years, while the number of inmates has continued to rise. The CPT said there was “need for profound reform of the prison system at the highest political level”, and that taking “resolute action to tackle the problem of violence in prisons in England and Wales” was a “prerequisite” for the successful implementation of other elements of the authorities’ reform agenda. The Committee requested the UK authorities to provide within six months a response giving a full account of action taken to implement them, and added that unless determined action is taken to “significantly reduce” the current prison population, the improvements envisaged by the authorities’ reform agenda would remain “unattainable”. Mr Kelly said the Committee had “reservations” about the extent to which the UK Government is currently giving the issues the necessary political priority, saying initiatives that have been announced about building new prisons and recruiting prison officers are not sufficient. “We’re seriously preoccupied about the extent to which prisons in England are unsafe, both for prisoners and for prison staff,” he said. “Since we’ve been going to the UK the prison population has doubled, but there have been significant cuts in staffing. In a number of the prisons we went to the inter-prisoner violence was absolutely endemic. It was spiralling out of control. “This is an issue that the UK authorities are well aware of. Liz Truss has spoken about it on a number of occasions. But the reservation we have as a treaty body is about the extent to which tackling this problem of violence is really being given the political priority that it should be given and that it needs.  “They are proposing a programme of recruitment of additional prison officers, but the problem  is prison officer numbers have fallen so low that when you bring younger staff into prisons straight from training, they’re coming into a very intimidating environment, and a lot of them are not staying there. “They’ve said they’re building more prisons, but the authorities need to be looking at measures to make sure that the capacity and the population actually come into balance. Building new prisons in itself is not a solution.” Responding to the report's findings, John Wadham, chair of the UK's National Preventative Mechanism, said: “This report is an important reminder that there is much to be done to improve the conditions in which people are held and how they are treated. Governments and detention authorities need to involve our members in their work to take forward these recommendations and to improve the conditions in our prisons, hospitals and detention centres. “I am particularly concerned by their finding that a number of children held in one young offender institution spent 23.5 hours a day locked in their cells. I agree with the CPT that such conditions amount to inhuman and degrading treatment.

" Investigation exposes serious allegations of international human rights breaches at young offenders institutions in the UK British prisons are holding child inmates in solitary confinement in an alleged breach of UN torture rules and British law,  has found. Lawyers in one case have launched legal action against the Government in the High Court. More than a dozen examples uncovered by   include a teenage prisoner with a serious mental health condition who, it is claimed, was placed in solitary confinement inside a number of different British jails during a period of six months, causing him considerable distress and psychological damage. Prison inspection reports suggest some children have been driven to self-harm due to the severe emotional distress of solitary confinement. MPs have called for an urgent Government investigation into the findings, which may breach the UN Convention Against Torture and the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child by amounting to inhuman and degrading treatment.  Tim Farron, leader of the Liberal Democrats, said: “These are incredible allegations that fly in the face of Britain’s obligations both domestically, at European level and internationally. The use of solitary confinement should be kept to a bare minimum regardless of age but is incomprehensible for juveniles.” The High Court legal challenge is an application for a judicial review concerning a boy who, it is claimed, is currently being held in solitary confinement.   has agreed not to publish further details. If the case is granted, it would lead to a case against the Government.  Article 16 of the UN Convention Against Torture states that governments must prevent any “acts of cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment” from occurring at the hands of officials.  The Special Rapporteur of the Human Rights Council on torture has previously stated that “the imposition of solitary confinement, of any duration, on juveniles” contravenes UN rules.   But an investigation by   has exposed allegations of solitary confinement being used in young offenders institutions (YOIs), which house 15-18-year-olds, across the UK, despite the Government’s official stance that the practice does not take place. The Ministry of Justice maintains that “segregation” of minors occurs for their own safety, which can involve them being isolated but not for significant periods of time. However, lawyers claim that “segregation” at some prisons meets the legal definition of solitary confinement. Under international human rights law, the Mandela Rules define solitary confinement as “the confinement of prisoners for 22 hours or more a day without meaningful human contact”.  Journalist Carrie Gracie speaks to the media outside the BBC in London after she turned down a £45,000 rise, describing the offer as a botched solution to the problem of unequal pay at the BBC.

Laura Janes, legal director for the Howard League for Penal Reform, said she had worked with at least six teenage boys under the age of 18 in the last two years who have been in conditions of solitary confinement, for periods ranging from weeks to up to six months. Of these, one boy was placed there for a period of close to four months while another was held for a period of close to three months, she said.‎  Prison inspection reports suggest the Government has known since at least 2015 that “segregation” restrictions amounting to solitary confinement have taken place at some YOIs.  An inspection report written by government prison inspectors following a visit to Feltham YOI in 2015 stated: “Twenty-six per cent of the [prison] population were being managed on units under a restricted regime that excluded them from activities and meant that they were unlocked for less than an hour a day – in effect solitary confinement.” Inspectors warned: “We found examples of boys … who were locked up for too long with nothing to do and a few cases of boys who said that isolation brought about by restricted regimes had caused them to self-harm.”  They added: “The segregation environment remained grim and quite inappropriate for children, with no suitable facility for face-to-face interventions, such as education.”  In the same year, a report by the National Preventative Mechanism, an independent body which monitors treatment of prisoners, stated of YOIs: “In many cases, isolation outside the formal care and separation unit lasted for more than 22 hours a day, and could last for several weeks … In some instances, children are held for long periods in conditions that amount to solitary confinement.” The mother of a teenage inmate, who spoke to   on condition of anonymity, said her 16-year-old son, who suffers from a serious mental health condition, was placed in solitary confinement at a number of different institutions over a six-month period last year. She claims while he was there, 13 other boys were also held in isolation units nearby his cell.  She said: “He was on 23 and a half hours in the cell. He was allowed out for a shower or a phone call for half an hour every other day. The cell was disgusting, conditions were filthy. His education was very few and far between; hee was slipped a piece of paper under the door – nothing meaningful for education.” She said families of prisoners felt unable to complain about the treatment amid fears it would make their children’s lives even harder: “You can’t say anything, it’s a catch-22,” she said. “No one seems to listen, no one seems to care.” The mother added that now her son has returned to a mainstream prison cell but still struggles with the emotional toll of solitary: “He’s so used to solitary now. He can’t handle human interaction when we visit him with his siblings, he can’t bear to see the children moving about or making noise.” Another inspection report from 2015 report into Werrington prison in Staffordshire states: “Education outreach visited the unit daily but because of the high occupancy levels boys received as little as half an hour education every other day. We were particularly concerned about the impact on boys’ development of prolonged periods with no activity and limited time in the open air. “It was inappropriate that the boys were denied access to showers, exercise and telephone calls in response to poor behaviour.”  Lawyer Laura Janes, told  : “Solitary confinement for children isn’t just cruel – it’s also unlawful.  Because they’re locked up the whole time, these kids have no sense of time and space. They eat in their cells. There is no education and there is nothing for them to do. They have no meaningful interaction beyond shouting through their cell doors at each other. Their lives become devoid of meaning and full of frustration. “One boy I worked with was in solitary confinement for most of six months. In prison he was considered too dangerous to mix with others but once he was released, he was fine. It was not about him but the environment he was in. It’s obvious cooping children up will impact on their health; they need exercise and structure.” Kimmett Edgar, head of research at the Prison Reform Trust, echoed the concerns, telling  : “The UN’s rules on child detention explicitly exclude the use of segregation due to the damaging effects it can have, with research consistently showing that involuntary isolation undermines mental health. The state has a binding duty to ensure the safety and wellbeing of all children and particularly those it detains.” MrFarron added: “These are some of the most vulnerable members of our society and their time in young offenders institutions must be focused on education and rehabilitation. I urge the Government to investigate these claims.” A spokesperson for the Ministry of Justice said the Government stands by its position that solitary confinement does not happen in the UK. They said in a statement: “When young people in custody are putting themselves or others at risk, segregation can be used as a last resort for limited periods of time when no other form of intervention is possible. “The safety and welfare of young people held in custody is a priority and we will be setting out our plans to reform the way we manage young offenders.” We use cookies to enhance your visit to our site and to bring you advertisements that might interest you.

" Kyefer, who is routinely held in his cell for 23-and-a-half hours a day, tells   solitary confinement is having a compounding impact on his mental health Seventeen-year-old Kyefer spends 23-and-a-half hours a day between the four walls of a small cell. In the room is a bed, a shower and a desk. He lies on his bed and does nothing. A meal is delivered three times a day through a slot in the door, which he eats alone. He has no television, and only a few books to keep himself occupied. Since he was referred to Cookham Wood Offenders Institution's Segregation Unit several months ago, the teenager has been receiving no form of regular education. The only stint of daily exercise he gets in the Kent jail is at around 8:30am, when inmates on his wing are allowed half an hour outside. Kyefer was sentenced to life at the age of 14 on a joint enterprise conviction for a murder and has been at Cookham Wood since January. He has been repeatedly moved between the “segregation” unit and B1, also known as the “progression” wing, during which he says he experienced solitary confinement for more than 20 days in a row. A report published by the Inspectorate of Prisons earlier this year on Cookham Wood, which holds boys aged 15-18, revealed that in both units, inmates are routinely locked in their rooms for more than 23 hours a day, in a regime it described as “inadequate”. “It’s depressing. It’s stressful,” says Kyefer, according to his mother. He speaks in short sentences and sounds worn out, despite having been cooped up for hours. It’s around 2pm, but he says he woke up just moments before. “I sleep a lot. Sometimes being stuck in here makes me angry. Mostly it’s lonely,” he adds. Locking juveniles up for 23-and-a-half hours is a breach of human rights law, according to the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture (CPT). Earlier this year, the Committee   that young offenders at Cookham Wood were on occasion being held in conditions “akin to solitary confinement” for up to 80 days for reasons of “discipline and good order”. An   by   in February exposed more than a dozen examples of child inmates being held in solitary confinement, including teenage prisoners with serious mental health conditions for whom it caused considerable distress and psychological damage. Kyefer, who grew up in Liverpool and, since his sentence, has been held in five different jails, was recently diagnosed with a borderline personality disorder. His mother, Sheena Evelyn, says she was told by his psychologist that his mental state is declining due to the trauma of being separated from his family at a young age and then locked up with no human contact. A recent psychiatric report on Kyefer seen by  shows that on a number of occasions he reported feeling “stressed by being in his cell too much”, “frustrated with being in segregation” and “frustrated with being in his cell for a long time”. Ms Evelyn says Kyefer phones her whenever he can because he is so distressed. “He phones me whenever he can just to speak to someone. There’s no education. Nothing. These boys are getting 30 minutes out of the cell exercise and that is it, she told  “Staff have told me that's the standard procedure. Off the back of that, they’re going to be misbehaving. They’re caged like animals. So then they go back to segregation. It’s a vicious circle. They bounce from segregation to B1 wing. The Howard League for Penal Reform, which recently launched a court case challenge over a teenage boy's prolonged solitary confinement in Feltham Young Offenders Institution, has warned of the “irreversible risk of harm” that can result from the prolonged isolation, saying it raises “serious child protection concerns”. “Kyefer has always been an energetic child. Now he always disengaged and depressed. Even when I visit him with his younger siblings, he isn't engaging as well as he used to. This prison is breaking him, says Ms Evelyn. “He’s threatened to take his own life on multiple occasions. Staff have ignored his pleas. It’s falling on deaf ears. Has there got to be a death of one of these boys before something happens? It comes as the Chief Inspector of Prisons   this week that young offenders aged 15 to 18 in Feltham Young Offenders Institution, where Kyefer reportedly spent six months in solitary confinement before being moved to Cookham Wood, are being locked in their cells for almost entire days and deprived of education and activity. A “restricted regime” has resulted in a notable rise in the use of solitary confinement, in which four in 10 inmates are locked up during the school day, inspectors said. An earlier report by the Inspectorate on Cookham Wood found that while there were some positive developments in the prison, the regime on the segregation unit was “inadequate”, while the regime for the most challenging boys on B1 was “insufficient”. Laura Janes, legal director of the Howard League for Penal Reform, told The Independent: “This practice of keeping a child in isolation has been raised as a very serious issue by a range of expert bodies.  It raises really serious child protection concerns. “Research suggests that prolonged isolation of anyone, let alone children, can bring with it irreversible risk of harm.  Prisons are sometimes permitted to limit children from mixing with other children, but that  can only be in accordance with prison rules in which require all sorts of reviews  to take place.

"  Findings mark 'all new low' for Government, says Labour The Government’s flagship refugee programme is under fire for failing to accommodate the most vulnerable people fleeing the  . Exclusive figures obtained by   show that just five per cent of refugees resettled under the scheme have disabilities, such as mobility issues or special educational needs, despite estimates that more than one in five people escaping the conflict are disabled. Labour said the findings marked an “all new low” for the Government, claiming that the Home Office’s treatment of refugees contradicted British values. Local council workers complained that central government was taking a “one size fits all” approach to refugee placement, with little consideration of how to accommodate complex needs. Meanwhile, councils were accused of providing “shopping lists” of the kinds of families they wanted that excluded the most at-risk groups. Figures released by 251 councils under freedom of information laws show that 5,529 Syrian refugees were resettled under the Vulnerable Persons Relocation Programme (VPRP) between January 2014 and April this year. Of those 288, or 5.2 per cent, were registered as disabled. Yet the   calculates that 15 per cent of people worldwide have a disability — and the proportion is higher among those fleeing conflict.  estimates around 22 per cent of Syrian refugees in Lebanon and Jordan have serious impairments. The organisation found that 80 per cent of significant injuries were a result of the Syrian war. Those not resettled in Britain and other European countries remain in camps and cities in Syria's neighbour states, including Jordan, Lebanon, Egypt, Iraq and Turkey, where UN human rights experts warn disabled refugees face inadequate access to essential services and medical care.   The VPRP – which commits the Government to taking in 20,000 refugees by 2020 –  , including the elderly, the disabled and victims of sexual violence and torture. Revelations about how many disabled refugees the UK accepted came after   in February reported that   from a different scheme because it could not cope with their needs. Labour-led councils in the UK took 69 per cent more disabled refugees per capita than Conservative ones, analysis revealed. The gap widened to 82 per cent when it came to the overall number of Syrians.  Meanwhile, SNP-led councils took almost five times as many refugees with disabilities per capita as Conservative ones, housing 19 for every million people, compared to the Tories’ four, analysis showed.   has based its calculations only on upper tier authorities that provided full figures. Around half (48 per cent) of the 288 disabled refugees the UK resettled were accepted by just 10 councils. Coventry took 23 people with mobility issues or special education needs – the most of any local authority – closely followed by Glasgow and Nottingham, which took 20 each.  Louise Calvey, head of resettlement at  , said an area’s politics was “a seismic factor” in determining whether a council would participate in the refugee scheme. She added that some councils were daunted by the prospect of accepting responsibility for people with disabilities. “When you [resettle] someone with a high level of additional needs it can be frightening. I think a lot of people are quite nervous about committing to that.” In some areas, Ms Calvey said, a severely limited amount of accessible housing meant even councils that were willing to re-home disabled refugees could not. “They can’t magic houses up, they can't suddenly develop a whole list of bungalows that wheelchair users can access easily, she said. The difficulties finding housing for disabled refugees were “no different from the  face,” she added. Recent welfare reforms, including the  , have made it even harder to accommodate people with complex needs, she claimed. “You’ve already got people being resettled into poverty, which makes me shudder,” she said.  Jazz Shaban, co-chair of Bicester Refugee Support in Oxfordshire, said local authorities were allowed to choose the kind of family they resettled, meaning some councils avoided helping those with the highest level of need. “Local authorities have a shopping list of the sort of family they want,” she said. “Generally they’re not asking for people with complex needs. The words I’ve heard used are a ‘steady family’.”   Not only was there variation between councils, but there were large differences in regional responses to refugees with disabilities. Scotland resettled almost four times the number of disabled refugees per capita than England. The north-east of England took more than eight times the number of disabled refugees per head than London. Parts of the country that voted for Brexit were less likely to take disabled refugees than those who opted to remain in the EU. Pro-remain areas accepted 44 per cent more disabled Syrian refugees per capita than Eurosceptic ones. For total Syrian refugees the difference was 43 per cent.   Peter Barnett, from Coventry Council, criticised the Government for not doing enough to support disabled refugees. “We are not helped by the one-size fits all nature of the Home Office programmes, which do not really address the additional support required by people living with disabilities,” he said. Shadow Home Secretary   pointed to cases where central government failed to take up offers from local councils to house refugees. Responding to the figures, she said: “This is truly appalling and an all new low in this Government’s treatment of refugees, discriminating against the disabled. “Just over a year ago when   made her first speech as Prime Minister she   ‘a disability or a health condition should never dictate the path a person is able to take’. But this has clearly been a factor blocking the legitimate right of vulnerable refugees to seek asylum in this country.   “This Government’s treatment of refugees is simply not in line with British values.” Melanie Ward, Associate Director of Policy and Advocacy at the International Rescue Committee said the UK’s pledge to resettle refugees made specific reference to supporting disabled Syrians. She said it was “disappointing” that the UK had not fulfilled its goal of catering for the most vulnerable refugees. “At a time where we are pushing European countries to expand their resettlement programmes, particular attention should be paid to ensuring the needs of disabled refugees are met,” she added. “It is vital that the UK recognises that disabled refugees are often among the most vulnerable, and are exactly those which resettlement seeks to protect.” The UN’s refugee agency, UNHCR, said “much more needs to be done” to cater for the most vulnerable refugees.  “Reception and integration support is key to successful resettlement through ensuring that resettled refugees are properly received and have the support and services they need to integrate into their new society and live fulfilled lives,” a spokesperson said. The Home Office said the findings were “inaccurate” but was unable to provide numbers that contradicted  ’s figures. A spokesperson added: “Almost a third of the families who have arrived include at least one person with either mobility issues, a serious medical condition, psychological problems or special educational needs. “Given the hardships that they have faced, the reality is that the refugee families we resettle are all vulnerable, for a number of different reasons. How we place each family is carefully considered on a case by case basis — in collaboration with local authorities and the UNHCR — taking into account all relevant information.” A man crosses a street in Aleppo, December 12, 2009 Reuters A vendor sits inside an antique shop in al-Jdeideh neighbourhood, in the Old City of Aleppo, December 12, 2009 Reuters A view shows part of Aleppo's historic citadel, overlooking Aleppo city, Syria Reuters A view shows part of Aleppo's historic citadel, Syria  Reuters Visitors walk inside Aleppo's Umayyad mosque, Syria  Reuters People walk inside the Khan al-Shounah market, in the Old City of Aleppo, Syria  Reuters A man walks past shops in al-Jdeideh neighbourhood, in the Old City of Aleppo, Syria  Reuters People walk along an alley in al-Jdeideh neighbourhood, in the Old City of Aleppo, Syria  Reuters Visitors tour Aleppo's historic citadel, Syria December 11, 2009 Reuters A general view shows the Old City of Aleppo as seen from Aleppo's historic citadel, Syria December 11, 2009 Reuters People walk near Aleppo's Bab al-Faraj Clock Tower, Syria October 6, 2010 Reuters A man stands inside Aleppo's historic citadel, overlooking Aleppo city, Syria December 11, 2009 Reuters   Refugees with disabilities in countries surrounding Syria live in particularly poor conditions, since they struggle to access healthcare and other support, human rights organisations have  . One disabled Syrian man   spoke to was stranded in Lebanon with little access to medical care for two years. Hussein Ejrf, who was eventually resettled in the UK in November 2015, suffered catastrophic injuries when his dairy farm was shelled by both government and opposition forces in Quneitra, south-west Syria. When the 41-year-old father of four arrived in Lebanon he could not afford the surgery or medicine he needed. Eventually, his left leg had to be amputated, a procedure he believes would not have been necessary if he had been treated properly. “It was a tragedy living in Lebanon,” he said. On when one occasion when Mr Ejrf was in intensive care, his wife Hayat searched for three days for someone with a matching blood type. When she eventually found a donor, doctors refused to administer the blood until they paid $100 (£76), Mr Ejrf said. They did not have the money, and Ms Ejrf had to beg strangers for help. Mr Ejrf now lives in Coventry with his wife and their four children. He visits the GP every month and gets the medication he needs. When he first arrived in the UK, he wanted to get a driving licence, but now he says he is “thrilled” with his electric wheelchair.

"  Children in custody left with urgent needs unmet due to reduced services in secure training centres — with one child left waiting more than seven months for mental health intervention Children in custody are facing a “significant shortfall” in mental health provision, with some given no access to psychology services and having to wait more than half a year for treatment. Young offenders aged between 12 and 17, many of whom suffer with mental health problems, are being left with urgent needs unmet due to reduced services in secure training centres (STCs), according to recent Ofsted inspections. STCs are for young offenders aged between 12 and 17 and house between 50 and 80 inmates. They are designed to house more vulnerable children than Young Offender Institutions (YOI), which can hold up to 400 offenders aged between 15 and 21. One centre, Oakhill STC in Milton Keynes, run by security firm G4S, employs one psychiatrist who visits the institution for two hours each week to meet the needs of 75 children. At the time of the inspection, one young person in the centre had been waiting for seven months for a mental health intervention. An Ofsted report last month revealed that psychological and psychiatric services at Oakhill STC had been “significantly reduced” since the previous inspection, with demand “considerably higher” than the services available to meet children’s urgent needs. Campaigners and MPs have described the findings as extremely troubling and called on the Government to take immediate action to improve the mental health provision in STCs, which they urge is denying children the chance to rehabilitate. Children and young people in custody are three times as likely as their peers to have unmet mental health need, with many having experienced multiple traumas during their young lives such as neglect, abuse and maltreatment. Ofsted rated all three STCs in England as “needing improvement” for their healthcare services, but the mental health provision at Oakhill is considerably lower than Medway and Rainsbrook. Oakhill is the only STC still run by G4S, after the other two STCs were recently taken over after concerns were raised about the company's management. Medway STC in Kent, which was taken over by the National Offender Management Service after a Panorama investigation exposed misconduct by G4S staff, has an “effective” child and adolescent mental health service, according to an Ofsted report published in June. The service is made up of five members of staff including a clinical psychologist, an assistant psychologist and a peer support worker.  But the report highlighted an issue with the fact that children are seen in the education unit for mental health and substance misuse interventions, which means there’s a lack of privacy which makes it more difficult for the clinicians to engage meaningfully with the young people. Rainsbrook STC in Warwickshire, which holds 58 children, has an integrated mental health team, with a newly appointed psychologist, according to a report published in August. But concerns were raised over the fact that there were 50 per cent vacancies in primary care, and psychological assessments of children were rarely accessed by staff. Meanwhile, in Oakhill STC — as well as long delays and the absence of any psychology service — self-harm and suicide risk assessments carried out by staff were reported to be extremely variable in quality, with many failing to consider critical relevant information such as previous serious mental health concerns. Ofsted inspectors said of Oakhill: Compared to our last inspection, psychological and psychiatric services are significantly reduced. This means that there are delays in accessing assessments and treatments, with one young person waiting for an intervention since March 2017. The psychiatrist's time is limited to two hours a week, which is largely used to review medicines. The only individual interventions are being delivered by the registered mental health nurses for low level needs [...] Some key services have been reduced since the last inspection: the resettlement team of case workers is smaller and there are no psychology services. In response to the findings, Shadow Secretary of State for Justice  Burgon “It is extremely troubling that hundreds of prisoners are not receiving their treatment for serious mental health problems in hospital and on time, but even more disturbing when vulnerable children are waiting up to six months for mental help treatment, as the recent damming inspection of Oakhill found.  “The Government needs to intervene and take immediate action to put an end to such cases. Everyone has a right to proper mental health treatment and cuts to already inadequate mental health treatment provision in STCs denies children a second chance and makes it harder to turn their lives around.” Andy Bell, deputy chief executive of the Centre for Mental Health, told   ready access to high-quality mental health support was “essential” for children and young people in custody, as these youngsters often have particularly high psychological needs. “Children and young people in custody have very high levels of mental health difficulty. It is therefore vital that whenever possible vulnerable children are not placed in custody, which can exacerbate mental health problems. And for those who are detained, ready access to high-quality mental health support is essential, he said. “We must ensure that all staff working in secure environments are trained and confident in supporting young people’s wellbeing and understanding trauma, backed up by specialist help for those who need it.” Naomi Murphy, psychologist and clinical director of a mental health unit in an adult prison, achoed his concerns, saying the lack of therapeutic services meant children in custody stood very little chance of not reoffending. “I find it appalling that we don’t have better therapeutic provision for children in custody. I’ve never in 20 years working with offenders met anyone who didn’t have therapeutic needs; their experiences are nearly always of neglect, abuse and trauma,” she said. “Children who find themselves in those services are children who will be vulnerable and will need some repairing and healing. It’s unforgiveable that we don’t offer something therapeutic. It becomes a vicious circle and means children are more likely to reoffend.” Frances Crook, chief executive of the Howard League for Penal Reform, said poor mental health provision was an indication that STCs were cutting costs, and urged that the institutions themselves cause children’s health to deteriorate.  “The lack of mental health services indicates these institutions are cutting costs. Psychiatrists don’t come cheap, whereas a barely trained warden with keys comes much cheaper,” she said. “There’s a problem with mental support for children anyway in the community, which may well have contributed to getting them into the STCs in the first place. Then when they get there, the institution itself contributes towards deteriorating their mental health. Oakhill STC's director, Lisette Saunders, urged that the company recognised that it needed to develop the secondary care provision in the centre in order to offer an more all encompassing mental health service for child inmates. “The health and wellbeing of the young people in our care is always our priority. G4S provides the primary care provision at Oakhill, which includes registered mental health nurses, learning disability nurses and a psychiatrist who visits on a regular basis, she said. We recognise that we need to develop our secondary care provision to offer an all encompassing mental health service for the young people. The psychiatric provision is currently under review by the Director and G4S Health Services to ensure access to sufficient psychiatric and psychological services is provided to meet the needs of young people. A Ministry of Justice spokesperson meanwhile said: “The safety and welfare of every young person in custody is our priority but we have been clear there is much more to do.

" British mother could have her sentence extended in court on Sunday. Speaking to  Richard Ratcliffe says Johnson's visit offers hope 'something good can happen' The husband of Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe has told   he hopes   will “redeem himself” on his visit to Iran, and secure his wife’s release.  was arrested on holiday in Iran last year, while visiting her family with her 22-month old daughter Gabriella, and accused of attempting to orchestrate a “soft overthrow” of the Islamic republic. She is now due to appear in court on Sunday on charges of espionage, which threaten to double her five-year sentence to ten.  The Foreign Secretary spent Saturday meeting officials in Iran and calling for Ms Zaghari-Ratcliffe’s release. Mr Johnson is due to meet Iranian President Hassan Rouhani on Sunday. In an interview with  , Mr Ratcliffe said: If he comes back with her, if he comes back and she’s released a couple of days later, then, of course, that more than redeems. Sitting here as her husband, I want her home. He did not cause her to be arrested. No one in the British government caused her to be arrested. She’s been held for a long time and I’ve been pushing the government to do more to get her home. And when they’ve done that, I’ll be eternally grateful to them. Last month the Foreign Secretary erroneously told a parliamentary select committee that Ms Zaghari-Ratcliffe  had been in Iran “training journalists.” Ms Zaghari-Ratcliffe works as a Project Manager for the charitable foundation of the news company Thomson Reuters, and was in Iran visiting family. Ms Zaghari-Ratcliffe has always maintained her innocence.  Gabriella is now three and a half and has been in Iran since her mother’s arrest. Mr Ratcliffe showed   some pictures of Gabriella, taken this week. “Gabriella is three, three and a half now,” he said. “And at three and a half she still doesn’t understand what’s going on. And obviously she’s lost her English so my communication is through translation. So she’s happy to show me a drawing she’s done or show me her dollies. Her wider understanding: she understands that Nazanin is in prison. She thinks that daddy is in prison as well. She understands that other children have their mummies and daddies come to pick them up and she lives with her granny instead. So she knows that this is temporary, and that soon it’ll be over. But her sense of time as to when this will end, and her sense of time of going back to London, what that means – even what prison is; prison is just where she visits mummy – luckily she’s too young to understand lots of it.” Migrants in a dinghy are rescued by Libyan coast guards off the coast of Garabulli, east of Tripoli Reuters French President Emmanuel Macron observes a minute of silence in front of the plaque commemorating late police officer Ahmed Merabet to mark the third anniversary of the Charlie Hebdo terrorist attack, in Paris Rex  Nicolaos Solis from Greece kisses the wooden cross which was thrown into the waters by Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew I, during the Epiphany ceremony to bless the waters at the Golden Horn in Istanbul AP Women mourn the death of a family member following a landslide in Kinshasa.

The two-hour meeting with Iranian foreign minister Mohammed Javad Zarif covered a number of areas, as well as Ms Zaghari-Ratcliffe's situation. Iranian authorities insist that the proceedings against Ms Zaghari-Ratcliffe followed the country’s judicial process. They also point out that Iran does not recognise dual nationality and thus she is regarded as an Iranian citizen. A Foreign Office spokesman said: They discussed the full range of bilateral issues and they both spoke frankly about the obstacles in the relationship, including the Foreign Secretary's concerns about the consular cases of British-Iranian dual nationals. Both emphasised their commitment to continuing to work together to improve the bilateral relations.” Mr Ratcliffe said he was keeping his “fingers crossed” that Mr Johnson’s visit could bring the ordeal to an end. “We’re sitting here with fingers crossed, fingernails being bitten, hoping beyond hope that something good can happen,” he said. “I know the Foreign Secretary will be meeting with the Iranian Foreign minister, the Iranian president, the head of national security and people from Iranian parliament. So a lot of important people that hopefully he’ll be able to unlock and find a way to bring her home. “Having the foreign secretary in Iran at the moment is really important and obviously we’ve been calling for him to try and get there before Christmas – he’s done that. We’ve been hoping he’d get there before her court case – he’s done that.” Mr Ratcliffe has previously said that news the Iranian regime had started referring to her as a spy had caused her to have a panic attack and require sedation.  “She’d never been called a spy before – that was an increase in the rhetoric,” Mr Ratcliffe said. “And that happened following the Foreign Secretary’s comments. So she was really shocked to the point where she had a complete panic attack and needed injections to sedate her.  Mr Ratcliffe said he was hopeful the court case might be postponed but cautioned that the Foreign Office has warned him there are “no guarantees.” “Fingers crossed that his presence means the court case is perhaps postponed, perhaps goes better than expected. But also potentially goes worse than expected. But hopefully fingers crossed him being there will hopefully means that, yeah, maybe we won’t have a day in court tomorrow,” he said. “I do believe that Nazanin can come home before Christmas. I certainly hope it, I’m not sure I expect she’ll be home on the next plane. It was arbitrary when it started, it can end suddenly as well. There are no guarantees. The Foreign Office have said behind closed doors that there are no guarantees.  My job is to be a little bit selective in my hearing if I’m honest, and keep hopeful.” We use cookies to enhance your visit to our site and to bring you advertisements that might interest you.

" Small print of Bill before Commons will alarm Brexiteers as a back door to remaining within the trading rules - despite EU withdrawal MPs will be able to vote for Britain to rejoin the EU customs union after Brexit without further legislation, a minister has revealed. The surprise admission delighted pro-EU MPs but will alarm Brexiteers who will view it as a back door to remaining within the trading rules, despite EU withdrawal. Ken Clarke, the former Conservative Cabinet minister and leading anti-Brexit rebel, said he was “considerably reassured” by what the Government was proposing. The admission came amid claims there is a majority in the Commons for staying in the customs union, because the fear of huge extra costs for businesses and chaos at Britain’s borders. Mel Stride, a Treasury minister, revealed the small print of the Taxation (Cross-Border Trade) Bill, which is needed for the Government to levy customs duties on goods traded with the EU, after Brexit. He insisted the UK will leave the trade bloc when it withdraws from the EU in March next year - but acknowledged a clause in the legislation would allow it to re-enter. “Clause 31 makes provision for the Government to enter into - or this country to enter into - a customs union with another territory,” Mr Stride said. “That territory could be the existing customs union of the European Union after we have left the European Union, it could be another territory apart from that.” MPs would simply have to approve a statutory instrument – a regulation, not fresh legislation – in order for that to happen, the minister added.

Businesses have repeatedly warned of their fears that leaving will bring an explosion in red tape, disruption to trade flows and huge queues at border points. MPs were told the Taxation Bill allows a “standalone” customs regime to be set up, for the UK to charge duties on imported goods and for the Government to decide how customs declarations should be made. During the debate, former Labour minister Chris Leslie said he would continue pushing his party's frontbench to support remaining in the customs union. And he said: “I happen to believe there's a majority in this House of Commons for membership of the customs union. “I have a little work to continue to persuade my own frontbench of this particular issue. I'll try my best to do that because I think eventually they will recognise, not just for the transition period but for the longer-term being, part of the customs union is incredibly important for our economy.” We use cookies to enhance your visit to our site and to bring you advertisements that might interest you.

" Business groups say changes will create major bureaucratic headache and cashflow problems for more than 130,000 firms More than 100,000 UK companies will be forced to pay VAT upfront after Brexit, under controversial government plans being debated by Parliament this week. Changes outlined in one of the many Brexit-related bills would force companies to pay the levy on goods at the point they enter the UK, rather than after they are sold. Business groups said the change would create severe problems for UK companies, including cashflow issues and additional bureaucracy. At least 130,000 UK firms will be forced to pay upfront import VAT once Britain leaves the single market, under which import tariffs are not imposed on goods bought from other EU countries. Currently, firms can register with HMRC for permission to import some goods from the EU free of VAT. They register the charge but the levy is added to the price of the product and paid by the customer. Under the new system being planned, the Government said, “import VAT is charged on all imports from outside the UK”. Businesses would then have to pay the tax upfront and claim it back at a later date, meaning they would be spending significant sums of money long before they recoup them in sales.

Mitigation measures could include companies instituting a revolving credit facility, or utilising import VAT deferment reliefs. “Both measures require companies having to take out costly bank or insurance-backed guarantees, so would increase the costs of importing goods from the EU.” The changes are contained in the Taxation (Cross-border Trade) Bill, which MPs are due to debate on Monday. Labour backbencher Chris Leslie told   he planned to table an urgent amendment that would keep the UK in the EU Vat area and therefore avoid the additional burden for British businesses. He said: If firms have to start paying VAT up front at border entry points, this could upend decades of normal business practices and add millions of pounds in bureaucratic costs that won't just hit profit margins, but will likely be passed on to customers via higher prices. One small business owner told  the changes would be disastrous for her company. Sally Stephenson, who owns The Pencil Case and The Toy Box, two independent high street shops in Cowbridge, South Wales, said: “My business isn't big enough to import directly, so I buy stock from wholesalers who do. At the moment EU products are imported into the UK without any VAT added, so those lower costs are passed all the way down the supply chain to end-users like me. If importers have to start paying VAT upfront - not to mention implement new time-consuming and expensive administrative and customs processes - these additional costs will have to be passed on. I anticipate cost prices will rise by at least 20p per cent if this happens, and retail prices will have to go up accordingly. My cost prices have already increased by an average of 13 per cent since the EU referendum, due to the fall in the value of the pound. A further 20 per cent increase on top of this would be disastrous for small businesses like mine. Stock accounts for two-thirds of my total costs and I simply cannot afford for prices to go up any more.

" Ex-communications chief Sir Craig Oliver tells BBC Radio 4 documentary series Eurosceptic Conservative MPs were 'lining up' like 'kamikaze pilots' to bring down former PM  feared he would be ousted as  leader if he did not commit to holding a referendum on Britain's membership of the  , his former communications chief has said. Sir Craig Oliver said Mr Cameron would have been hit by a wave of Conservative defections to  if he had not promised to give the country the opportunity of an in/out vote. In an interview for the BBC Radio 4 series  , Sir Craig said Eurosceptic backbenchers had been “lining up” to become “kamikaze pilots” and bring him down. Following months of speculation, the then prime minister announced in January 2013 that there would be a referendum if the Conservatives were returned to power in the general election in 2015. Sir Craig said Mr Cameron and those around him took the decision in part because the issue had become a “massive boulder in the road” for the Government, standing in the way of everything they wanted to do. “The second reason I think that they wanted to do it was that knowledge that actually they would probably have to go as leadership of the party if they didn't do it,” he said. “Now you could say, actually you could take a principled decision and say I'm not doing it. It's not the right thing for the country or the party. “But their view was, if they gave up, then somebody would be elected who would - and probably not do it in the way that they thought was best for the party in the country.” In the event two Conservative MPs,   and  , did defect to Ukip, but Sir Craig said there could have been many more. “There was absolutely no doubt that there were people who were lining up to do it and be kamikaze pilots to make sure that this thing happened,” he said. “There weren't specific numbers but I think that there was a sense that you could end up with, you know, another six to 10 that were just going.” Mr Cameron's policy chief Sir Oliver Letwin described how, after the Conservatives were re-elected, he was asked by the prime minister to try to persuade Boris Johnson to back Remain. “It was more than one phone call, it was a large number of meetings,” he told the programme. “It was part of a continuing conversation. And we didn't quite get there.” Sir Oliver said he believed the result “might well have gone the other way” if Mr Johnson had not decided to put himself at the head of the Leave campaign.

" Labour MP holds private talks with member states' governments on hypothetical aftermath of Article 50 being revoked The  would help the UK abandon  if it changed its mind, according to the  MP  , who has held private talks with most EU governments. In a new weekly column for  , Mr Umunna said the 27 EU members saw Brexit as a “damage limitation” exercise and did not want to punish the UK, as some Brexiteers claim. “They believe Brexit is bad for them and us,” he wrote. “If, when we see what the Brexit deal actually looks like, we want to change our minds and fight to reform the EU from within, they would be delighted.” Dismissing claims by some lawyers that the exit process could not be halted, he added: “There is unanimous acceptance that Article 50 is revocable and they would be very very happy for the UK to continue as a member of the club. That is why it makes sense to keep an open mind on what we do at the end of these negotiations.” Mr Umunna, who met EU government representatives in recent months as co-chair of the all-party Parliamentary Group on EU Relations, revealed that some officials privately describe the Government’s view of the EU’s position as a “fantasy” and a “delusion.” He warned the UK will not be able to “have its cake and eat it,” saying: “The problem is that most EU governments are not clear what May thinks a bespoke UK arrangement would look like.” He said no diplomat he had spoken to believes it would be possible to strike a trade agreement by the time a two-year transitional period ends in 2021. One senior EU representative told Mr Umunna  the UK lacks “a national position” on how to approach Brexit. He said EU members had noted the “backseat driving” by Brexiteers ministers such as    and   as they undermined Ms May by setting out their own “red lines.” The former Shadow Business Secretary contrasted the Government’s “incoherence” with “the iron discipline” of the EU27 in the talks. He said the   charm offensive, including one-to-one dinners with EU leaders, in Downing Street has in the main been rebuffed.

" The Brexit Secretary says the EU is scaring British businesses  has privately suggested that EU preparations for a ‘no deal’   are “damaging” UK interests and spooking British businesses into moving abroad. A leaked letter penned by the Secretary of State for Exiting the EU shows he has consulted government lawyers about European Commission “measures” which he believes could breach UK rights as a member state and put Britain at a disadvantage. The warning comes despite the British government implicitly threatening a ‘no deal’ scenario itself to extract concessions from Brussels, with Theresa May having said that “no deal is better than a bad deal”. Mr Davis said there were “a growing number of instances where the UK is treated differently by EU institutions before we leave the EU” and that this was “frequently damaging for UK interests”. “The EU has adopted a number of measures that put agreements or contracts are risk of being terminated in the event of a ‘no deal’ scenario and/or would require UK companies to relocate to another member state,” he states. Mr Davis cited Commission advice to businesses that they might have to do certain things – such as regulatory compliance – within EU borders after Brexit. He insisted that this was not certain because of the possibility of negotiating a positive future relationship.  The minister however admitted that “chances of a successful legal challenge against the measures taken so far are low” and that there would be a “high risk politically and financially” to taking the EU to court. In the letter, addressed to Theresa May, Mr Davis pledged to launch a counter-offensive to reassure UK businesses and also “press our case with the Commission”, including Michel Barnier’s negotiating team.  The missive, first   by the  , was also sent to Sir Jeremy Heywood, the UK’s top civil servant; Sir Tim Barrow, the UK’s ambassador in Brussels; Oliver Robbins, Downing Street’s Brexit chief; and Philip Rycroft, the top civil servant at DExEU. The Government has itself not shied away from the prospect of a no deal. Other than Ms May’s endorsement of the plan as a fall-back, there are reports that the Government is set to appoint a dedicated “minister for no deal” – though the post has as yet failed to formally materialise in this week’s reshuffle. Both the UK and EU however say they believe a deal can be struck, especially following progress on separation issues in December. On Monday a European Commission spokesperson said the EU had “for months now been busy on planning for all possible outcomes”.

" Richard Corbett says the studies are needed after the 'fiasco of the inadequate sectoral impact assessments'  Labour’s leader at the European Parliament has written to David Davis to demand regional Brexit impact assessments,   can reveal.  Richard Corbett MEP has called on the Brexit Secretary to take action after what he described as the “fiasco of the inadequate sectoral impact assessments”. Mr Corbett criticised the Government’s approach, saying there was still no explanation of what Brexit would look like and that decisions were being taken without “an awareness” of the consequences.   “After the fiasco of the inadequate sectoral impact assessments, we insist on the need for full and comprehensive regional impact assessments – our constituents need to know the government is considering the impact of Brexit on their local area, and taking this into account in its negotiations,” Mr Corbett said in his letter.  The Mayor of London has commissioned studies to look into the effects of Brexit on the capital and the Scottish government has already published their report on the economic impact of Britain leaving the EU.  Mr Corbett said it “cannot be right” that some parts of the country have impact assessments and others do not.  “If the government is to be confident that it is taking the right decisions in implementing the outcome of the EU referendum, it must have an awareness of the likely impact of those decisions on all the nations and regions of the UK,” he said.  Rory Palmer, Labour MEP for the East Midlands, said people had the “right to know” about the impact of Brexit and what it will mean for their livelihood.   “The government is taking decisions about Brexit without assessing its impact on my constituency of the East Midlands, or anywhere,” Mr Palmer told    “Following the chaos and confusion of the sectoral impact assessments that weren’t, the Brexit department or, if it is incapable of doing so, the Treasury, must commission analysis on the consequences for each UK region and nation. “People and businesses throughout Britain have a right to know what government decisions will mean for their jobs, their livelihoods, their futures – ministers must put consideration of them at the heart of its decisions.  “The bottom line is we need to know what will happen to us outside the EU. It is now more than one-and-a-half years since the referendum, and ten months since the triggering of Article 50 – the government cannot allow the chaos, uncertainty and confusion around Brexit to continue.  “People and businesses in every part of our country, in every region, in every community, need to know that the government is making decisions on the future with them in mind,” he added.   Independent research that has looked into the effects of Brexit on regions across the UK found that the South West had the largest share of local GDP exposed to Britain leaving the European Union.  A total of 13.7 per cent of the aggregate economy in the South West would be affected by Brexit, with the West Midlands and the North West not far behind with 13.5 per cent of their local economy exposed.  Of all the sub-regions in the country Cumbria was worst affected with a total of 16.3 per cent of their economy under threat once Brexit is finalised.   Migrants in a dinghy are rescued by Libyan coast guards off the coast of Garabulli, east of Tripoli Reuters French President Emmanuel Macron observes a minute of silence in front of the plaque commemorating late police officer Ahmed Merabet to mark the third anniversary of the Charlie Hebdo terrorist attack, in Paris Rex  Nicolaos Solis from Greece kisses the wooden cross which was thrown into the waters by Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew I, during the Epiphany ceremony to bless the waters at the Golden Horn in Istanbul AP Women mourn the death of a family member following a landslide in Kinshasa.

" Theresa May has urged EU citizens to stay in the UK after Britain leaves the bloc but uncertainty over post-Brexit rights has made some academics fearful for the future More than 2,300   have resigned from British universities over the past year amid concerns over a “Brexodus” of top talent in higher education. New figures show a 19 per cent increase in departures of European staff from universities last year compared to before the EU referendum, and a 10 per cent rise from some 2130 resignations in 2015-16.  has urged EU citizens to stay in the UK after Britain leaves the bloc but prolonged uncertainty over post-Brexit rights has made some academics fearful for the future, critics warn. It comes after a report from the British Academy warned that   due to prospective changes to immigration rules after Brexit, with subjects such as modern languages and economics facing the greatest threat. The institution reporting the highest number of resignations was the University of Oxford, which saw 230 departures of EU academics last year compared to 171 in 2014-15, according to freedom of information requests by the Liberal Democrats to 105 universities. However the university pointed out that it has also recruited a large number of EU staff so the overall numbers were largely similar. A spokesman said: “The status of colleagues from other parts of the EU has been a major concern for the university and we have called for clear commitments on this issue to reassure staff and students who are already here or hoping to join us. “The recent joint report on Brexit negotiations confirmed the rights of academics and other staff currently in the UK but the university will continue to call for a free flow of academic talent to and from the EU in the final Brexit settlement.” King’s College London also lost 139 members of EU staff, compared to 108 before the referendum, while 173 EU academics resigned from the University of Cambridge last year, up from 153 staff the previous year, and 141 in 2014-15. The institutions that responded reported more than 25,400 European academics on their rolls, with 6,633 working on Stem subjects such as engineering, maths and computing, where the UK faces serious skills shortages. Another 4,922 work on vital areas such as health sciences, nursing or medicine, and 1,307 on business. Maike Bohn, a spokesperson for the3million, which campaigns for citizens’ rights, said some EU academics feel “personally insulted” by the Government’s sluggishness to guarantee their rights and remain concerned about what Brexit will mean for their futures. Ms Bohn, a German citizen who formerly worked at Bristol University and the Saïd Business School in Oxford, told  : “I think we will see a time lag on this as I know lots of people who are waiting to see if it gets worse before leaving. “It takes time to get a new position in Europe so I think we will see a delayed reaction.” Younger academics are worried about whether their qualifications will still be valid after Brexit, while others are concerned over their eligibility for lucrative European research grants once Britain leaves the bloc, she said. Liberal Democrat education spokeswoman Layla Moran said: “This alarming rise in EU academics leaving our universities is the latest sign of a damaging Brexodus. “Britain’s universities have thrived from having access to talented European researchers, and from years of European cooperation through schemes like Horizon 2020 and Erasmus. “Now all this is being put at risk by this Government’s botched handling of Brexit, where we seem to be losing all the benefits of EU membership while keeping the costs. “These valued members of our communities find themselves uncertain about the future and unconvinced by the too little too late wooing by an incompetent Prime Minister. While they were frozen out of the referendum, they are now voting with their feet.” The Prime Minister secured a deal with Brussels before Christmas that would allow EU citizens who arrive by March 2019 to apply for settled status if they have been living in the UK for more than five years. Anyone who has lived in the country for less than five years before the official exit date will be able to apply to remain until they have reached the five-year threshold.

He added: “The Government now needs to develop a post-exit immigration system that welcomes European and international university staff and students with minimal barriers.” A Department for Education spokesperson said: “The UK higher education sector has a long established tradition of attracting the brightest minds from around the world, at all stages of their careers. We value the contribution that EU staff make to the sector, and we want that to continue. “The citizens’ rights agreement allows for a fair and reciprocal deal that will guarantee the rights of more than three million EU citizens living in the UK and a million UK nationals living in the EU – so they can carry on living their lives as before.” We use cookies to enhance your visit to our site and to bring you advertisements that might interest you.

" Exclusive: Prime Minister accused of helping create the 'hostile environment' that paved the way for 'F*** off to Poland' messages, excrement through letter boxes,  The full extent and true nature of the “blatant hate” that has beset post-Brexit Britain is today detailed for the first time after   was given exclusive access to a database of more than 500 racist incidents compiled in the weeks since the EU referendum. The hatred that has divided British society in the past month features “F*** off to Poland” letters in Tunbridge Wells, wealthy London diners refusing to be served by foreign waiters,  and racist abuse from children as young as ten. What the social media sites in their own report describe as an “explosion of blatant hate” has included:  * Gangs prowling the streets demanding passers-by prove they can speak English * Swastikas in Armagh, Sheffield, Plymouth, Leicester, London and Glasgow.   * Assaults, arson attacks and dog excrement being thrown at doors or shoved through letter boxes. * Toddlers being racially abused alongside their mothers, with children involved as either victims or perpetrators in 14 per cent of incidents.   * A man in Glasgow ripping off a girl’s headscarf and telling her “Trash like you better start obeying the white man. * Comparisons with 1930s Nazi Germany and a crowd striding through a London street chanting: “First we’ll get the Poles out, then the gays!”   And in their own report – written with the support of the   – the three social media groups accuse the Prime Minister Theresa May of helping create the “hostile environment” that paved the way for post-referendum racism. Criticising Ms May’s record as Home Secretary, and in particular her endorsement of   “Go Home or face arrest”, the authors of   say:  “If a hostile environment’ is embedded politically, it can’t be a surprise that it takes root culturally.” Singling Ms May out as one of those who helped create such a ‘hostile environment’, the report recalls that in 2012, Ms May, the then Home Secretary, used a newspaper interview to declare: “The aim is to create here in Britain a really hostile environment for illegal migration.” The report says: “This was brought to fruition in July 2013 when the Home Office deployed mobile advans in six London boroughs telling people to ‘GO HOME or face arrest’ in its 'Operation Vaken'.” It adds, pointedly: “Around a quarter of the incidents recorded in our database, specifically use the words ‘Go Home’ or ‘Leave’. “It is not unreasonable to see the Vote Leave campaign, with its central focus on immigration, as a continuation of this politically mainstream, hostile stance towards immigration and xeno-racist narratives.” The report’s criticism of Ms May was echoed by the shadow Home Secretary Andy Burnham, who told  : “It is clear that the Government has contributed to the unwelcoming climate and that our new Prime Minister in particular is responsible . “This has been building for some time and Theresa May was blowing a dog whistle when she commissioned those ad vans. After the referendum she added to the problem by  . “Her failure to do that has left children being told to go home in their school playgrounds and in the streets where they live. This Prime Minister promised to pull the country together, but her actions have done the opposite.” He added: “This is not the Britain we have known. This is not ‘taking our country back’. It is making Britain a completely different place to the one we have known and loved.” Already police have said that reported  , and that 42 per cent more hate crime was reported to them in the last two weeks of June than there had been in the corresponding period of 2015.   The database shows that since the 23 June referendum, virtually no corner of the UK has been left untouched by racism - even areas that voted strongly to stay in the EU. The database includes incidents such as a Polish doctor treating patients in a hospital in Oxford, a city where more than 70 per cent voted remain, being told to “f***ing go back to where you belong.” While 76 per cent of incidents were restricted to verbal abuse, 14 per cent of cases involved threatened or actual physical violence. Neo-nazi stickers have gone up all around the Clyde and Glasgow Green in the last few days. This breaks my heart.  In Yeovil, Somerset, a Polish man was asked to prove he could speak English and then beaten to the point of suffering a potentially life-changing eye injury. The involvement of children as victims and perpetrators was described by the authors of  as “one of the most alarming and least expected trends”.   A two and a half-year-old Polish girl walking with her mother through a park in Croydon, south London, was told by a 60-something grandfather: “We voted to leave so why the f*** don't you go home? None of us want you here.” In Taunton Deane, Somerset, a 10-year-old told their German teacher: “I’m not doing what a bloody foreigner tells me to.”  Nor was the racism restricted to people who could be categorised as frustrated and socially excluded.   In an expensive restaurant in Mayfair, London, on the day the referendum result was announced, a party of celebrating Brexiteers refused to be served by an Italian and demanded an English waiter.  An online booking for another top London restaurant included the demand: “I want British waiter please (sic). Don’t send any Europeans to my table.” One of the most disturbing aspect of the incidents examined by   involved signs that some racists saw themselves as preparing to extend their attacks to other minority groups.   The database records a crowd walking down Drury Lane, London, chanting: “First we’ll get the Poles out, then the gays!” Reporting an attack on a Romanian lesbian in Oxford, the actress  suggested the incident showed “Strains of 1930s Nazi Germany”.   Priska Komaromi, the lead author of social media sites’ report, said the referendum debate and result had given some people the impression that there was no longer any shame in expressing the race hate they had long felt. Ms Komaromi, an academic researcher who helps run the PostRefRacism twitter page, told  : “The referendum result emboldened some people because it made them think that everyone agrees with them now.” Her report also claims that elements of mainstream politics and media has for years been creating an environment that encourages racist feelings. It states: “The rapid rise and the nature of hate crime following the referendum is an expression of the ‘hostile environment’ [that] the ‘insiders’ vs ‘outsiders’ rhetoric, increasingly prevalent in mainstream politics and the media, has fostered. “As Liz Fekete, director of the Institute of Race Relations puts it: 'One of the things that has become clear is that the hostile environment that has been an official aim of policy for the last few years is coming home. If a ‘hostile environment’ is embedded politically, it can’t be a surprise that it takes root culturally.'” The report adds: “While Islamophobic scaremongering was central to the Leave Campaign, it has been increasingly normalised in the mainstream media and politics in the UK since 9/11 …   and his attempt to paint Sadiq Khan as a ‘closet extremist’ are indicative of the patent islamophobia in mainstream politics.” The report also accuses the Brexit campaign - which placed heavy emphasis on taking back control of immigration - of “demonising migrants” and fostering “an idea of ‘Englishness that is exclusively white and Christian, targeting anyone who is different”. While criticising leading Brexiteers Michael Gove and Boris Johnson, it reserves its harshest comments for the ‘Breaking Point’ poster unveiled by the then Ukip leader Nigel Farage.  It calls it the most obvious example of “the de-humanisation of migrants, and particularly refugees.” The result seems to have been that while 51 per cent of abusers specifically mentioned the EU referendum, the most commonly targeted ethnic group was in fact people of South Asian, rather than European origin.  And around one fifth of the abuse aimed at people of South Asian origin was Islamophobic. We are clear that it is completely unacceptable for people to suffer abuse or attacks because of their nationality, ethnic background or colour of their skin. We will not stand for it Home Office spokesperson The post-referendum racism report comes days after the Government launched   in response to public anxiety at the hostility seen since 23 June. Launching the plan, which will include fresh guidance to the CPS and a £2.4 million fund for security at synagogues, mosques and churches, Home Secretary Amber Rudd said: “Hatred against any community, race or religion has no place whatsoever in our diverse society. We are Great Britain because we are united by values like democracy, free speech, mutual respect and opportunity for all.” Stressing that Ms May’s measures as Home Secretary had been directed at illegal – not legal – migrants, a Home Office spokesperson said: “It is categorically untrue to say the Home Office has called for a hostile environment for immigrants. However, the British public expect us to take decisive action to prevent immigration abuse and make it harder for people to enter or live here illegally. That is why we have introduced new legislation through the Immigration Acts in 2014 and 2016.  “We are also clear that it is completely unacceptable for people to suffer abuse or attacks because of their nationality, ethnic background or colour of their skin. We will not stand for it. That is why we have launched our new Hate Crime Action Plan, setting out the robust and comprehensive steps we will take to eradicate hate crime.” We use cookies to enhance your visit to our site and to bring you advertisements that might interest you.

" Commission President says EU must plan budget as if UK is leaving The president of the European Commission has warned against believing claims that   will not happen and that Britain will remain in the EU. Speaking at a discussion of the next EU budget in Brussels   said the Commission’s “working hypothesis” would be that “our British friends will be leaving us” and that future spending had to be planned accordingly. Mr Juncker said the loss of the UK, a net contributor, from the EU budget, meant other EU countries would have to contribute more. “We need more than 1 per cent [going to the EU budget] if we are to pursue EU policies and fund them adequately,” the Commission President said. “Don’t believe those who say [Brexit] is not going to happen. Our working hypothesis is that our British friends will be leaving us.  “Between now and then we need to find the means of reacting to the loss of a significant number of billion of euros when a net contributor goes.” Mr Juncker ruled out “drastic” cuts to the Common Agricultural Policy or EU cohesion funds, which he said were necessary to maintain Europe’s food security and to even out disparities in wealth between different parts of the union. Justifying increased spending, he said EU membership was worth roughly “one cup of coffee a day” for the EU taxpayer, adding: “I think Europe is worth more than one cup of coffee a day.” The current budget round started in 2014 and will end in 2020, and the EU will have to agree a new budget before then. The EU’s current budget is around €105 billion a year, or £92.8 billion. The largest gross contributors ahead of the UK are Germany, France, and Italy, who contribute around 21 per cent, 16 per cent, and 14 per cent respectively. The UK contributes 13 per cent. The UK had the second highest net contribution, however, behind Germany. Only nine of the 28 member states are net contributors to the redistributive budget. As part of ongoing Brexit negotiations, the European Parliament has called for the UK to make “commensurate” payments to the EU for access to the bloc’s markets – though UK figures, including Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, have ruled this out. Under the understanding reached by negotiators in December, the UK will continue to contribute to the EU budget until the end of the current spending round in 2020.

" The Home Office will provide a £40m cash injection  The Home Secretary is to unveil a £40m plan aimed at preventing a repeat of the child sexual exploitation scandals seen in Rotherham, Rochdale and Oxford.  Amber Rudd’s cash injection will be used in part to set up a National Centre of Expertise for Preventing Child Sexual Exploitation – to assist police forces in such investigations in the future. £20m of the fund will go to the National Crime Agency and £2.2m to charities working to protect children at risk of trafficking. The Home Secretary Amber Rudd said the plan would improve the UK’s ability to fight such crimes.  “Children should be able to grow up free from the horrors of sexual abuse, exploitation and trafficking,” she wrote in an article for the Mumsnet website. “Since 2010, the Government has done more than any other to tackle these horrific offences. We have increased support for victims of sexual abuse, invested in training and technology to improve law enforcement's response to abuse both on and offline, and brought in a tougher inspection regime to ensure all front-line professions are meeting their child protection duties. “But there is more to do. The measures I am announcing today will further improve our ability to protect children and under my watch I am determined to bring those that would try to steal their childhood to justice.

" Ms Greening walked out after Theresa May reportedly tried to move her to another department Damian Hinds has been appointed as the new Education Secretary after Justine Greening resigned from the Government. The former work and pensions minister was promoted to Theresa May's top team as part of a new year's reshuffle aimed at reasserting her authority after the poor general election result.

" John Humphrys sat beside co-presenter Carrie Gracie and explained how he couldn't interview co-presenter Carrie Gracie ... So he was going to talk to another presenter For an hour and a half they just about managed to keep on the straight and narrow as a serious news programme. Then, just after the 7.30am news, the   programme went the full For those who don’t know,  is the BBC’s satire of management culture at the BBC.  It’s fiction, but real events constantly conspire to make it look more like a documentary. As Monday’s   programme – broadcast in the wake of an  caused by the BBC’s China editor resigning in protest at a “secretive and illegal” gender pay gap – was about to prove. “Let’s pick up that story about the woman sitting next to me,” said  , male, £600,000-£650,000 salary, in the studio beside … Yup, co-presenter, very much  -BBC China editor,  , female, pay £135,000 and flipping angry. Not that Mr Humphrys could just turn his chair slightly and, you know, interview Carrie Gracie about the row concerning Carrie Gracie. Because if Carrie Gracie is presenting the BBC programme discussing the row about Carrie Gracie, Carrie Gracie can’t discuss the row about Carrie Gracie on the programme discussing the row about Carrie Gracie. Or, as Mr Humphrys earned some of his hefty salary by succinctly explaining: “Now, BBC rules say presenters of a programme aren’t allowed to use that programme to declare their own views.  A presenter can’t suddenly turn interviewee... So I need to talk to another presenter.” So it was that John Humphrys, with Carrie Gracie sitting beside him, discussed the row about Carrie Gracie with   who was not next to him, but talking down a “bad line” from “rainy Somerset”. Not to worry, though, this is the BBC.  Other media organisations might keep their skeletons in triple-locked cupboards, never to be mentioned on-air, online or in print, ever.  Not the Beeb.

But now, an hour after the  programme finished, Carrie Gracie  discuss the row about Carrie Gracie because she was no longer  the programme discussing the row about Carrie Gracie, and the BBC had devised a cunning plan.   “Jane Martinson,” explained Ms Garvey, “Is a freelance journalist. She is in our radio car and she is going to speak to Carrie Gracie.” (Location unstated, but presumably fairly close to the BBC studio.) So what, finally, did we learn once Gracie could speak unfettered by BBC impartiality rules about her’s BBC pay? Well, if you will send a fearless reporter to examine the actions of a secretive, “heavily censored one party state” [as she put it in her  ] … “I could NOT go to China and collude, knowingly, in what I considered to be unlawful pay discrimination,” said the dissident Gracie.   “NOR”, she added, “could I stay silent and watch the BBC perpetuate a FAILING pay structure by discriminating against women.” “I chase around being surveilled the whole time”, she explained (talking about China not the BBC), “dealing with intimidation, dealing with police harassment.” She added: “Every day I go out without fear or favour, facing intimidation in China, facing censorship, actually telling the story and shining a light. “I am not going to NOT shine a light when I find a problem in my home organisation.” “I didn’t want more money,” she said. “I wanted equality, and there was still a big gap between myself and my male peers.” She didn’t name those male peers, but they were presumably her international editor counterparts,   the US editor who was revealed in July to earn £200,000-£249,999 a year, and Middle East editor  , £150,000-£199,999.  And yes, Ms Gracie did have the self-awareness to add: “I believe in public service broadcasting. I do think salaries at the top are unacceptably high, for presenters, and stars and also the managers.” Which might not have been music to the ears of BBC director-general    .   They had already tried a   of rank-and-file BBC staff pay that found “no systemic discrimination against women”.  On Monday the BBC added a statement that declared: “Fairness in pay is vital. A significant number of organisations have now published their gender pay figures showing that we are performing considerably better than many.” But journalists and presenters, male and female, within the BBC and at other organisations, were still   of the dissident Gracie. Carrie Gracie’s stand is important. It’s about respect as well as reward. We don’t want future female broadcasters, journalists, reporters, commentators, editors & producers to have to fight for the right to be paid equally for doing the same job.      As a former union rep at the BBC I say: solidarity to   - tip of the iceberg  And the dissident Gracie was now doing a pretty fine job of talking for herself. Maybe it was time for Tony Hall and chums to have a meeting, try a bit of good old managerial blue-sky thinking? Ms Gracie has already   she is returning to the BBC newsroom, presumably as a presenter: so what about telling wonderful Carrie she can have that presenting job for life (while gently reminding her about those BBC impartiality rules for presenters)?   There may, alas,   of  , but the   programme is back again tomorrow morning.   We use cookies to enhance your visit to our site and to bring you advertisements that might interest you.

"  Government appeal process condemned as ‘traumatic’ and a ‘waste of time and money’ Ministers have spent almost £40m in an “appalling” attempt to stop sick and disabled people receiving the financial help they are entitled to,  can reveal. Freedom of Information requests have exposed how taxpayers’ money has been spent on futile legal battles to prevent vulnerable people receiving help.  The hit to the public purse could also be far higher than the new data suggests because it is still unclear how much more the state spends running courts where sanctions are challenged.  The vast majority of appeals were lost by the Government last year, making the expense appear unnecessary. Early indications now show the problem is becoming even worse in 2017, with a 77 per cent rise in money spent trying to stop people from getting Employment and Support Allowance ( ) payments. Critics claim the situation has arisen because fitness to work assessments are deeply flawed, leading to incorrect decisions which need to be fought. Senior Labour MP  , who worked as  ’s poverty tsar, said: “What’s appalling is that the [Government] is prepared to spend £39m of taxpayers’ money against people who are desperately fighting off destitution.” New figures show that in 2016 the Government spent £22m processing claimants’ initial appeals against sanctions – a stage most people must pass through before they reach a tribunal.  It emerged earlier this year that government officials are given targets to reject four out of five initial appeals – known as mandatory reconsiderations – for some disability benefits. Further data obtained by   under Freedom of Information law shows the Government then spent a further £17m fighting cases in the courts that were not settled at the initial appeal stage, bringing the total appeals process cost to £39m last year.  One case where the claimant’s wife went into premature labour and had to go to hospital. This caused the claimant to miss an appointment.

The charity shop had told him they didn’t want him there Terry Eaton, 58, was sanctioned because he didn’t have the bus fare he needed to attend an appointment with the job centre In the same period the Government lost 62 per cent of the tribunal cases in which it was attempting to sanction a claimant’s ESA – which supports people when impairments prevent them working. They also lost 65 per cent of the cases in the latter half of 2016, the most recent period for which figures are available, relating to the Personal Independence Payment (PIP), a longer-term benefit. But the defeats suffered by government lawyers are not persuading ministers of the need to change tack, with the figures actually pointing to a more costly appeals process in 2017. The Government spent £1,166,459 trying to take benefits from ESA claimants between January and March 2016, and £2,069,849 in the same period this year – a 77 per cent rise. Meanwhile, the proportion of cases where judges found that claimants were too ill to work also increased. In the first three months of last year judges decided in favour of claimants in 58 per cent of cases. That figure rose to 70 per cent in the same period this year, suggesting the Government is denying payments to more people who are genuinely unfit to work. The costs that have been exposed so far only refer to those incurred by the   ( ) and do not include money spent by the Courts and Tribunals Service, which carry out the appeals.  Both PIP and ESA claimants have to complete assessments after which the DWP determines whether an applicant will receive payments and what level of support they will get.  If an applicant wants to challenge the decision made at their assessment they have to complete a mandatory reconsideration, in which the DWP will re-examine a claim. If the decision is not overturned at a mandatory reconsideration, a claimant can then take the DWP to an independent tribunal. There is usually both a doctor and a judge sitting on the panel who will reexamine the case. Chair of the Commons Work and Pensions Committee Mr Field added: “We clearly need a new compact between the [Government] and claimants, otherwise this injustice will continue to act as a recruiting agent for  .” Critics believe the Government’s system for assessing if people are eligible for benefits like ESA and PIP are at the root of the problem.  Currently PIP assessments are contracted out to private firms   and Capita, which do not require employees performing the assessments to have relevant expertise in specific disabilities. It has led to reports of cases where physiotherapists have assessed claimants with mental health problems. One ex-civil servant who suffers from Parkinson’s told   how he won his case to receive financial help through the appeals system only to be informed he will have to be reassessed next year – despite his illness being degenerative. Jeffrey Sturt, 59, said his assessor was “hostile” and “spoke down” to him. The former civil servant said he thought “people would walk away from challenging decisions because they are aggressive”. “Minimum overheads, maximum profits – that’s what they’re going for,” he added. One woman who suffers up to 30 epileptic seizures a month, said the Government took her back to a tribunal twice after she won her appeal. Citizens Advice said it is seeing more cases such as this, where the DWP does not accept the judge’s decision. During the period when she was waiting to hear the outcome, the 38-year-old woman’s illness became worse and the frequency of her fits increased due to stress. “You start panicking about it,” she said. “You think, ‘Have they forgotten about me?’” She finally won her case after 18 months. She asked: “What was the point in that? How much money did they waste on me?” In April it was reported that Atos and Capita had been paid £578m so far for assessing people for PIP since it launched in 2013. Their contracts were due to expire in December this year but have been extended to July 2019, according to the DWP. Michelle Mitchell, chief executive at the MS Society, said: “These exorbitant costs point to a welfare system that clearly doesn’t make sense. We know that many people with MS aren’t getting accurate decisions the first time around. Being forced to go through the lengthy and stressful appeals process is a waste of time and money, and also harms people’s health.” Ken Butler, who leads on benefits policy at  , said inaccurate assessments too often denied disabled people justice until their independent tribunals. “I think the problem is that things go wrong at the very start and then they’re hard to put right,” he said. “If the assessments were better then you wouldn’t have the need for mandatory reconsiderations. The system now only functions really to put people off going any further – the whole process is quite lengthy and stressful.” Chief executive of Citizens Advice Gillian Guy said: “Last year Citizens Advice helped people with almost 400,000 PIP issues, up 37 per cent on the previous 12 months. Many come to us concerned that the outcome of their PIP assessment doesn’t accurately reflect the support needs they have because of their health issues. The next steps can be time-consuming, distressing and even costly if people have to pay to gather additional evidence.” Margaret Greenwood, shadow minister for employment and inequalities, said: “These figures are a clear demonstration that the current assessment process, which causes significant stress to ill and disabled people, is not fit for purpose. The flawed Tory assessments are a damning indictment of this Government’s cruel social security reforms and seven wasted years of austerity. In addition to putting unnecessary pressure on people who need support, these assessments have created waste and expense with thousands overturned in the courts.” A DWP spokesperson responded to the new findings by highlighting the low number of overturns as a proportion of all decisions made since 2013. They said just 3 per cent of PIP decisions and 4 per cent of ESA decisions made at initial assessment had been overturned in that period. Yet changes to the system make comparisons difficult. “In the majority of successful appeals, decisions are overturned because people have submitted more oral or written evidence,” they said.

" Senior health professionals and campaigners have now come together to take legal action and demand a judicial review Legal action is being taken against   and the   over their proposals to restructure the NHS,   can reveal.  Plans have been tabled to convert the   into a public/private enterprise, which critics say is based upon the US private health insurance-based system. Senior health professionals and campaigners have now come together to take legal action and demand a judicial review, to ensure full parliamentary scrutiny of the proposals. Under NHS England's new plans, the boundary between health and social care would be dissolved and new systems and structures would allow alternative funding sources, ultimately leading to the creation of new healthcare overseers called Accountable Care Organisations (ACOs). ACOs would permit commercial, non-NHS bodies to run health and social services. They could be awarded huge contracts to manage and provide whole packages of care, allowing the ACOs to either provide the NHS service themselves or sub-contract it. This means ACOs will have control over the allocation of NHS and taxpayers’ money but their accountability for spending it and their obligations to the public will be under commercial contracts, not government statutes. Solicitors representing prominent NHS campaigners have now contacted Mr Hunt to inform him that they are seeking a judicial review in an attempt to ensure parliament can fully scrutinise the proposals. They claim the Department of Health’s consultation process was limited, inadequate and unlawful due to the lack of national consultation or parliamentary approval. Dr Colin Hutchinson, Professor Allyson Pollock, Professor Sue Richards and Dr Graham Winyard are all working together to put the case to the Department of Health.  Prof Pollock, a BMA council member and co-author of the  , said the proposals were an attempt to Americanise health care in England and that the NHS was progressively being dismantled. Our NHS has been an international model for countries around the world for a health system that represents fairness, efficiency and freedom from the fear of illness. It has provided health care for all free at the point of delivery through public funding, public ownership and public accountability,” Prof Pollock told  “Its popularity has endured since 1948 and is a symbol of all that is decent about Britain. However it is being starved of funds and progressively dismantled and replaced with corporate structures known as Accountable Care Organisations which will facilitate the introduction of American-style healthcare systems. “These latest proposals are the tipping point in steps towards the Americanisation of England’s health care. “The government has not only failed to consult the people of England about its plans but it has failed to lay its proposals before parliament.  In so doing, it is acting beneath the statutory radar in attempting the Americanisation of our health care and this fundamental re-organisation by stealth. “We call on everyone to support this legal action against the Secretary of State for health to ensure proper national public consultation and full parliamentary oversight and scrutiny,” she added. A Department of Health spokesperson said: “It is completely inaccurate to suggest ACOs are a step towards an insurance based system. They have absolutely nothing to do with the funding model of the NHS, which will remain a taxpayer-funded system free at the point of use, and are simply about making care more joined-up between different health and care organisations. “It is irresponsible to scare vulnerable patients with these type of misleading allegations.” The news comes as   after years of funding cuts. NHS and social care leaders have written to Chancellor Philip Hammond to demand an increase in the pace of investment and an end to public sector pay restraint.

" Cabinet divisions over the UK's approach were exposed in the House of Commons on Tuesday European leaders are still finding it hard to understand the UK's position on Brexit despite   having been triggered seven months ago, the Irish prime minister has said. Taoiseach   said ambiguity in the official position and mixed messages coming from ministers meant the EU’s 27 other national leaders struggle to grasp what the UK really wants from negotiations. His comments came along side others from   President  , who said “we need to know what the UK wants to do” over  , ahead a key meeting of the   which starts on Thursday. It follows a   in London on Tuesday when two senior cabinet ministers appeared to contradict each other over the UK’s approach to a ‘no deal’ Brexit. Mr Varadkar said: “It's still not clear what the UK actually wants in terms of a new relationship, because on the one hand it seems that the UK wants to have a close trading relationship with Europe like it has now, but it also seems to want something different. “It is very hard for us as European prime ministers to understand exactly what the UK wants the new relationship to look like.” In an interview with the BBC's   programme, he went on: “It certainly can't be, and I think anyone will understand it can't be, having all the benefits of EU membership but none of the responsibilities and none of the costs.

Mr Tajani said the UK Government was “not realistic” in its approach to the financial settlement and echoed Margaret Thatcher's language when she secured the British rebate, saying: “We need our money back…this is important for us.” The figure of around £18bn that Ms May was offering so far is “peanuts”, he said, with “the real situation” being a sum of around £45bn to £53bn. He told BBC's  : “We need not one euro more, not one euro less.” Differences within the Cabinet were illustrated on Tuesday as Home Secretary   suggested that a “no deal” scenario was “unthinkable”, at least on security issues, while Brexit Secretary   insisted the UK had to keep open the option of walking away from the talks. There are also divisions over how close any future relationship will be, leading Mr Tajani to say: “In the Conservative Party there are different positions.

The UK has previously been criticised by EU leaders over claims that the country's Brexit plans lack sufficient depth or detail, but Foreign Secretary   denied it on Tuesday and urged the EU to “get on” with talks to ensure timely progress is made.

" Perception of unfairness extends beyond supporters of Labour leader A majority of the British public believe the media is deliberately biased against Jeremy Corbyn and seeking to portray him in a negative light. Just 29 per cent of British adults disagreed that the “mainstream media as a whole has been deliberately biasing coverage to portray Jeremy Corbyn in a negative manner” when   by pollsters YouGov. 51 per cent of people agreed that coverage had been deliberately biased and while 21 per cent said they were not sure. Labour voters were even more adamant with 69 per cent alleging bias, while a staggering 97 per cent of Labour members and supporters intending to vote for Jeremy Corbyn in the leadership election perceived bias. Supporters of Owen Smith within the Labour party were actually significantly less likely to believe coverage against Mr Corbyn had been biased than the general population or regular Labour voters. 44 per cent said coverage had been biased but 53 per cent said it had not. Women in the Labour selectorate were more likely to believe the coverage was biased than men and older people in the group were also more likely to believe it had been deliberately biased – despite Mr Corbyn’s higher support generally with younger people. The poll findings chime with the conclusions of a study by academics at LSE researched earlier this year. The academics assessed the content of eight national newspapers between 1 September and 1 November 2015, when Mr Corbyn was first elected and found most articles failed to properly represent his actual views on issues. YouGov polling also found that numbers Mr Corbyn’s supporters believe a number of theories about the Labour leadership election.  Jeremy Corbyn and Owen Smith clash at a leadership hustings in Gateshead, where Mr Smith was scarcely able to answer a question without being booed by Mr Corbyn’s supporters PA “Jeremy himself admitted he was seven out of 10 in terms of his faith in the European Union. He said it,” said Mr Smith during his second live debate with Jeremy Corbyn  Ballot papers are currently due to be sent out on 22 August and returned a month later, with the result being announced at a special Labour conference on 24 September  Jeremy Corbyn supporters cheer and wave placards as the Labour Leader addresses thousands of supporters in in Liverpool, England  Labour Party leadership candidate Owen Smith poses for a picture with supporters during a picnic for young members in London Fields, Hackney in London  The Labour leader has a spring in his step at a leadership rally in Sunderland Screenshot Labour leadership contender Owen Smith delivers a speech at the Open University in Milton Keynes, where he promised to reverse Conservative cuts set to leave millions of low paid workers thousands of pounds a year worse off PA Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell has urged Owen Smith to distance himself from those saying they want to split the Labour party  90 per cent of Mr Corbyn’s supporters believed PR agencies were in some way involved in orchestrating the coup of Labour MPs against him, while 55 per cent said it was likely that the intelligence services, including MI5, were working to undermine him. These theories were less popular with the general public, with 45 per cent and 19 per cent of GB adults also subscribing to them respectively.

" The Prime Minister is said to be 'disappointed' by her departure from government  has quit her job as education secretary after Prime Minister   tried to move her to another department in her latest  . After a standoff during a gruelling three-hour meeting in Downing Street on Monday, Ms Greening walked out of the Cabinet. The former minister was pushing to stay in her education brief and was unwilling to accept a different job offered to her by the Prime Minister.  Downing Street aides said Ms May was “disappointed” but respected Ms Greening’s decision to leave. Ms Greening had been promoting her achievements at the Department for Education in recent days after facing criticism from Ms May’s allies. She had been attacked for not being as loyal to Ms May as others and not being on the same wavelength as her over her education reforms. But as Ms Greening received word that she was being pushed out of her department, she began a counteroffensive at the weekend touting rising school standards and new measures to boost literacy. The Prime Minister offered Ms Greening a job at the Department for Work and Pensions, but failed in her attempt to keep the minister from quitting in protest at the move from education. Ms Greening was succeeded as Education Secretary by Damian Hinds, who was promoted from being a junior Work and Pensions Minister. The way Ms Greening left the Government could cause a headache for the PM when the Putney MP, who backed Remain in the referendum campaign, returns to the backbenches.

" Mr Corbyn has got a hostile reception from the press Britain’s media is the “mouthpiece” of capitalism’s elite and an obstacle to Labour winning a general election, the general secretary of Britain’s biggest trade union has said. Speaking at Labour’s annual party conference in Liverpool Len McCluskey, who leads Unite, said the media “feared” Jeremy Corbyn winning an election. The warning comes a day after Mr Corbyn was re-elected as leader of the Labour party after a challenge from his internal opponents. He won an increased majority of 61.8 per cent of the vote. “It’s our principles and our ideals that will carry the day once we get through the obstacle of the media – who are the mouthpiece of the establishment of the corporate elite. Of course they want to stop Jeremy Corbyn and John McDonnell,” Mr McCluskey told a fringe session. “The truth is, the reason they attack him and say he’s useless and he’ll never ever win a general election – if that was true, if they really believed that they’d want him to stay there.  “The fact is they want to get rid of him, not because they think he can’t win a general election. It’s because they fear he can.” Mr McLuskey’s comments received a standing ovation from some attendees at the fringe session, which his trade union had ironically organised jointly with the  . The general secretary also used his platform at the hustings to criticise the Labour-supporting newspaper, saying he was “disappointed” with its critical coverage of Mr Corbyn during this summer’s Labour leadership election. “It would be hypocritical of me if I didn’t register my disappointment with the manner in which the   has conducted itself during the leadership contest,” he said. Mr Corbyn has himself previously been critical of the media, refusing to speak to reporters outside his home and berating journalists at a press conference for asking off-topic questions. A study conduced by LSE academics and published earlier this summer found that about three quarters of coverage of Mr Corbyn had failed to accurately present his views. True. In a speech made to the Stop the War Coalition in 2009, Mr Corbyn called representatives from both groups “friends” after inviting them to Parliament.
He later told Channel 4 he wanted both groups, who have factions designated as international terror organisations, to be “part of the debate” for the Middle East peace process.
“I use (the word ‘friends’) in a collective way, saying our friends are prepared to talk,” he added.
“Does it mean I agree with Hamas and what it does? No. Does it mean I agree with Hezbollah and what they do? No.” Reuters Partly false. David Cameron used this as a line of attack at the Conservative Party conference but appears to have left out all context from Mr Corbyn’s original remarks.
In an 2011 interview on Iranian television, the then-backbencher said the fact the al-Qaeda leader was not put on trial was the tragedy, continuing:  “The World Trade Center was a tragedy, the attack on Afghanistan was a tragedy, the war in Iraq was a tragedy.” False. A Daily Express exposé revealed that the Labour leader’s ancestor, James Sargent, was the “despotic” master of a Victorian workhouse.
Addressing the report  at the Labour conference, Mr Corbyn said he had never heard of him before, adding: “I want to take this opportunity to apologise for not doing the decent thing and going back in time and having a chat with him about his appalling behaviour.” This one is true. On 21 May 2004, Mr Corbyn raised an early day motion entitled “pigeon bombs”, proposing that the House register being “appalled but barely surprised” that MI5 reportedly proposed to load pigeons with explosives as a weapon.
The motion continued: “The House… believes that humans represent the most obscene, perverted, cruel, uncivilised and lethal species ever to inhabit the planet and looks forward to the day when the inevitable asteroid slams into the earth and wipes them out thus giving nature the opportunity to start again.” It was not carried. False. A report in The Times referred to Mr Corbyn, known for his cycling, riding a “Chairman Mao-style bicycle” earlier this year.
“Less thorough journalists might have referred to it as just a bicycle, but no, so we have to conclude that whenever we see somebody on a bicycle from now on, there goes another supporter of Chairman Mao,” he later joked. False so far. The Sun report in December was allegedly based on a “rumour” passed to the paper by a Daily Express columnist who has written pieces critical of the Labour leader in the past. The minister did not materialise in his shadow cabinet. False. Another gem from The Sun took comments made at a Hiroshima remembrance parade in August 2012 where Mr Corbyn supported Costa Rica’s move to abolish it armed forces.
“Wouldn’t it be wonderful if every politician around the world…abolished the army and took pride in the fact that they don’t have an army,” he added.
The caveat that “every politician” must take the step suggests Mr Corbyn does not support UK disarmament just yet. False. The Guido Fawkes blog claimed that the Labour leader took sandwiches meant for veterans at at Battle of Britain memorial service in September but a photo later emerged showing him being handed one by Costa volunteers, who later confirmed they were given to all guests. True. After much speculation about Mr Corbyn’s republican views and willingness to bow to the monarch, his office confirmed that he did not attend the official induction to the privy council because of a prior engagement, but did not rule out joining the body. Partly true. The Labour leader was filmed standing in silence as God Save the Queen was sung at a Battle of Britain remembrance service but will reportedly sing it in future.
Mr Corbyn was elusive on the issue in an interview, saying he would show memorials “respect in the proper way”, but sources said he would sing the anthem at future occasions. True. The group lists its purpose as the following: “To increase awareness of issues surrounding the dairy industry and focus on economic issues affecting the dairy industry and producers.” According to polling by YouGov conducted at the start of this month just 29 per cent of British adults disagreed that the “mainstream media as a whole has been deliberately biasing coverage to portray Jeremy Corbyn in a negative manner”. Fifty-one per cent of people agreed that coverage had been deliberately biased and 21 per cent said they were not sure.

" ‘We would take back control of our entire energy grid and all commercial energy producers’ Momentum activists have created a mock general election manifesto with suggestions that all energy companies should be nationalised, the Trident nuclear deterrent be scrapped and a universal basic income to become policy. The grassroots organisation established shortly after Jeremy Corbyn’s election as leader in 2015, hosted the session, by Talk Socialism Newcastle, at its World Transformed festival – an event running alongside Labour’s annual conference in Liverpool. Organisers created a scenario in which a “snap general election” had been called and asked activists to write Labour’s 2017 election manifesto to go to the British public. Momentum activists were then split up into seven areas – economy, defence, environment, education, housing, health, constitutional reform – and asked to create one central policy each. Following the policy announcements, there was then a “press conference” where a spokesperson for each policy area was held to account. To the amusement of the audience, journalists included Rachel from the “Torygraph”, Trevor from the “Daily Fail” and Charlotte from the “Impartial”. On the environment the mock policy suggested that the Labour party will run a national energy board after “taking back control of our entire energy grid and all commercial energy producers”. This, they added, would “empower the new government, enabling us to guarantee that we exceed the 50 per cent reduction in carbon emissions by 2025 which was set by the Climate Change Act”. The defence policy would “oversee the transition from an outdated nuclear deterrent to a modern defence strategy that meets the challenges of the real threats we face in the 21  century”. The group in charge of constitutional reform called for the House of Lords to be abolished, a move to proportional representation and the lowering the voting age to 16. On the economy, activists suggested the party adopt a citzens’ basic income, which will “provide economic security for everyone and abolish poverty”. They added the policy “will cut through welfare bureaucracy and allow people to take back control of their lives, in a world where work and wages are more precarious than ever”.     Momentum activists have been asked to create a mock election manifesto at fringe event. Here's their econ policy:    It comes after   and hailed the movement for their “significant” contribution to his leadership campaign. He added that ideas put forward by the left-wing group are “absolutely essential”.  Holding a copy of The World Transformed schedule of events, the Labour leader said: “This event here might be described as some kind of fringe extreme ...

" The Labour leader made an unexpected speech and received a rapturous applause from activists Ideas put forward by Momentum, the grassroots campaign set up to build on Jeremy Corbyn's victory, are “absolutely essential”, the Labour leader has said. In a surprise speech at Momentum’s festival – “The World Transformed” – Mr Corbyn, who on Saturday beat his rival in the leadership contest with 62 per cent of the vote, thanked activists for their “significant” contribution to his campaign. The Momentum event in Liverpool, which is happening at the same time as Labour’s annual conference, aims to “promote a radical, positive vision for the future” and includes four days of workshops, exhibitions, gigs, poetry and discussions about Mr Corbyn’s next steps. Holding a copy of The World Transformed schedule of events, the Labour leader said: “This event here might be described as some kind of fringe extreme ... I see the kind of discussions that are in this programme here absolutely central and mainstream to how people think and what we're trying to do.” He described this leadership election as “different” because it was a “challenge” and “we had to have a leadership election we hadn’t necessary planned for”. “But what’s been fascinating is the number of people that have attended leadership campaign events… the total attendance was tens of thousands at all of the rallies and that was to me something highly significant,” he said to rapturous applause. “People don't want politics that is top-down decision-making, they don’t want to be told there is no economic alternative. What’s exciting about politics at the moment is that after the general election we decided many of us – well not very many of us, a small group of us in Parliament decided – there had to be an alternative offered to austerity light and acceptance, in a sense, of the economic agenda that has been laid down in for the last 30 years in Western Europe and the United States. “The reason I was put forward for leadership last year was to challenge the economic agenda of the times and what was amazing and interesting was the huge support and resonance there was for that alternative,” Mr Corbyn said. Shortly after Mr Corbyn’s re-election as Labour leader on Saturday, Momentum held a celebration which was attended, according to one source, “by half the shadow Cabinet”. Activists, it was added, heard from the shadow Chancellor John McDonnell, and Labour MPs, Dawn Butler, Clive Lewis, Emily Thornberry and Kate Osamor – an indication of how crucial Momentum is viewed by the Labour leader’s inner-circle.

" Work will begin near Bolton in March, with 50 million trees set to be planted before 2050 The Government has announced plans to create a new forest spanning more than 120 miles of land around the M62 motorway in the north of England.

The plan will see 50 million trees planted in areas between  and   over the next 25 years, with the project to be overseen by the Woodland Trust and Community Forest Trust. Around 62,000 acres of land will be planted before 2050 in order to create new woodland around major cities including Liverpool, Manchester, Leeds and Bradford. The Government has pledged an initial £5.7m towards the project, which is the first attempt of its kind since planting of the   began in the 1990s. In total, the Northern Forest is expected to cost £500m, with the vast majority of funding coming from charitable sources. Announcing the plans, Ms May said: “It is vital that we leave our planet in a better state than we found it, with cleaner air, stronger protections for animal welfare and greener spaces for everyone to enjoy. “Progress is being made. We’re investing over £3bn in improving air quality, tackling marine pollution by banning harmful microbeads and increasing sentences for animal cruelty to five years. “But to create an environment fit for the future we can’t stop there, and that is why we are supporting the creation of this new Northern Forest and will shortly be setting out our ambitious vision to further support the environment and protect its good health for generations to come.” Journalist Carrie Gracie speaks to the media outside the BBC in London after she turned down a £45,000 rise, describing the offer as a botched solution to the problem of unequal pay at the BBC.

" Exclusive: At least 500 incidents in the last five weeks have included racist letters in Tunbridge Wells, swastikas from Plymouth to Glasgow, chants in London of ‘First we’ll get the Poles out, then the gays!’ and violence in Yeovil On the morning of Tuesday June 28, five days after Britain voted for  in the  , a single telephone call turned a routine radio talk show into something far more disturbing. Karen, the caller, was sobbing, barely able to contain her fear, or bewilderment. I'm so scared,” she said. “I’m German. I’ve been here since 1973. My [late] husband was British, a GP. I have lived here 43 years … I never had any problems before … I am so scared now.     “I have had friends of mine saying they can’t be friends any more … I am so frightened. I have had dog turd thrown at my door, told to go back home … My neighbours told me they don't want me living in this road and they are not friends with foreigners. “My friend's grandson, seven years old, got beaten up because he had a foreign grandmother. “I haven’t been out of the house for three days.  I am so, so scared.” Seemingly shocked, the LBC host   did his best. He told Karen that however they had voted, the huge majority of British people were on her side. She was not alone, he insisted. And indeed social media soon rallied with expressions of outrage at the racists and support for Karen.  But the grim truth remained inescapable. Karen really wasn’t alone. Because there were hundreds of other victims. After the Brexit result, after a referendum debate where  racism had bared its teeth.   Cards saying “no more Polish vermin” were  Racist graffiti was daubed over the entrance of the Polish Social and Cultural Association in Hammersmith, west London.   By June 27 the National Police Chiefs’ Council was saying in the aftermath of the EU referendum. And now   has analysed some 500 accounts of incidents collected by the twitter page  , the website , the Facebook group   and the  , to map the race hate that has occurred since June 24, the day the referendum result was announced. It is everywhere: swastikas in Armagh, Sheffield, Plymouth, Leicester, London and Glasgow; dog excrement through the letter box in Rugby; “F*** off to Poland” letters in Tunbridge Wells. It is in hospitals: in Oxford, a city  , a Polish clinician was told to “f****** go back to where you belong. A nationwide poll for Network Locum, an online platform for GP locums, this week found that almost half (47 per cent) had noticed more racism after the Brexit vote.  It is in schools: the daughter of a Polish family told to “f*** off back to your country” by a classmate in Essex; a British Asian girl in Broadstairs, Kent, being asked “When are you going home?” by her fellow primary school pupils.   Out of the 500 incidents examined by  , 47 - nearly ten per cent - featured children as either victims or witnesses to racism directed at their parents.   In 26 of the racist incidents, children were the perpetrators. The youngest where the age could be verified was 10 years old. Nor could glib generalisations about this being the work of the disenchanted and disenfranchised account for everything. On June 27 PostRefRacism was told about the online booking made for a “top London restaurant.”   “9.30pm,” it read. “I want British waiter please. Don’t send any Europeans to my table.” And describing her tormentors, Karen herself had noted, incredulously: “I live in a middle class area. The people doing it are middle class pensioners.” Much of this racism has been triumphalist in tone, vicious in intent, and even more irrational than you might imagine. China has no hope of joining the EU and its free movement zone. That didn’t prevent an 81-year-old Chinese pensioner, a UK resident since 1964, being told to leave and asked why she was still here after the Brexit vote, by a group of teenage schoolchildren in Colchester, Essex.

Hundreds later participated in a ‘love bombing’ rally outside the shop to express their opposition to racism and their support of the shop owners.

In neighbouring Dewsbury, a seven-year-old Muslim girl and her family were told: “It’s the best day ever today: go home all of you.”  The Archbishop of Canterbury has railed against    And he should know. He delivered his House of Lords speech on July 5, eight days after a guard at his own cathedral told a brown skinned UK-resident: “Dover’s that way, love.” My home town of Newcastle. This afternoon. I feel like I am back in the 1980s.  It seems we now live in a country where gangs of men can stop passers-by and demand proof that they can speak English; where a Polish man in Yeovil facing such a test can be beaten and left with a potentially life-changing eye injury. In a Leicester shop, a young Polish girl can be told she must now pay for her previously free bag because “We voted leave and now  have to pay  . And in London a group can walk down a Covent Garden street chanting: “First we’ll get the Poles out, then the gays!” “First they came for the Jews,” seems to have sprung to some minds. Reporting an attack on a Romanian lesbian in Oxford, the actress Juliet Stevenson saw: “Strains of 1930s Nazi Germany”.   And yet, in a thoroughly counterintuitive way, it may be possible to see something positive in the 500 reported incidents. Because they  reported. “I actually get worried when reported   go down,” says Assistant Chief Constable Mark Hamilton, the lead on hate crime for the National Police Chiefs’ Council. “That’s when I worry about whether we are in touch with communities, or whether people are suffering in silence.” By contrast, he says, the very act of reporting a hate crime sends the message: “This society reports this because it considers it unacceptable.’” He invites you to draw your own conclusions from a colleague’s finding that “there is more hate crime reported to the police in London than in the whole of the US” - despite the US having 35 times London’s population and all the tensions suggested by the  Here, people have reported race hate – and their anger at it – in droves. PostRefRacism - encouraging people to use social media to record and draw attention to racist incidents - was started, not by any official organisation, but by 24-year-old Karissa Singh. The day after the referendum, while drinking with her brother in South Kensington, she was told: “I know we’ve voted to leave Europe but we should have voted to kick all you lot out.” Ms Singh and her brother told the man they were born in Newport Gwent Hospital, Wales, and were as British as he. Then she started PostRefRacism. It has now acquired 9,790 followers - if we live in a society where these things can happen in the first place, perhaps we also have many, many people who refuse to let evil flourish. There are the ‘All People are Welcome Here’ signs in Deptford, south-east London, the hundreds who  whose shop was attacked by arsonists. In Glasgow they have responded to the swastikas by writing “Nae room fae racism” on the pavement. The figures also suggest a temporary spike, akin to the recorded after the Paris attacks last November. The referendum debate and result emboldened a lot of people. They felt justified. They thought they could say racist things in public. They lost their shame Liz Fekete, director of the Institute for Race Relations Mr Hamilton says that there were 225 hate incidents reported to the police in the UK on June 24 and 289 incidents the day after.  But by June 30 they were down to 110, closer to the pre-referendum ‘norm’ of about 190 per day.   All of which leads Mr Hamilton and others to suggest that we are not witnessing any sort of 1930s Germany scenario. Rather, it is a glimpse of what may have been hiding in plain sight for years - “floating hate”, Mr Hamilton calls it.   Although that itself might seem disturbing enough.   Before, suggests Liz Fekete, director of the Institute for Race Relations, the hate was simmering but, “They had this idea that it was not correct to be overtly racist.” “Then the referendum debate and result emboldened a lot of people. They felt justified. They thought they could say racist things in public. They lost their shame.” And so on the morning of 24 June, a London landlord told his Romanian tenants, with undisguised hostility, that he wanted them out of the house as soon as possible. The Romanians protested that the tenancy agreement wasn’t up, that they had got on well for years. The landlord said he didn’t want to rent to immigrants any more. Neo-nazi stickers have gone up all around the Clyde and Glasgow Green in the last few days. This breaks my heart.  And the impression that this “floating hate” had been there all along, waiting for a chance to boil over, was reinforced by the testimony of a Romanian in Hull. He was subjected to three anti-immigrant diatribes in one post-referendum bus ride - but the only unusual thing about it was the frequency of the racist jibes:  “I'm a Romanian living and working in the North of England. I am normally on the receiving end of racist comments on a weekly basis.” “The referendum may have given them licence,” concludes Mr Hamilton, “But these people weren’t born on referendum day.” You can, indeed, find signs of a long back story to post-referendum racism. Like, for instance, the sign placed at a bus stop near Thetford, Norfolk. “P*** off home EU scum,” it said.  “We don't want your grubby berry picking paws dragging round here, ruining our beautiful English land with your swan eating.” Swan eating. It’s also mentioned on the website of Liberty GB, the party   as a candidate in the Batley and Spen by-election caused by the death of Jo Cox. Look beneath the 27 April article on immigration issues and the EU referendum, in the comments about “Polish parasites” and the need to deport “All Africans, Pakis AND SLAVS,”: posted by someone calling themselves “Britishswaneaters.” Go back 13 years, and you will find one possible inspiration for such talk. In 2003, even before the immigration brought about by the 2004 accession of 10 East European countries to the EU, The Sun, under the headline “Swan Bake”, was writing about “callous” East European asylum seekers “barbecuing the Queen’s swans.” The tabloid would later publish a clarification acknowledging that no asylum seekers had actually been arrested for such alleged offences, despite the story stating: “Police swooped on a gang of East Europeans and caught them red-handed about to cook a pair of royal swans.” But by then, the paper had already published the sequel: “Now they’re after our fish!” Which might offer one possible explanation for Britishswaneaters’ joshing reference to another Liberty GB supporter – who merely wanted to “ban human rights, ban Islam, close all borders and shoot everything what comes close” – as “carp poacher”. The PostRefRacism twitter feed includes a montage of another newspaper’s horror stories – bold block capitals screaming “Migrant invasion”, “Migrant flood” and “Migrants take ALL new jobs in Britain.”  Liz Fekete of the Institute of Race Relations is adamant. This isn’t just about the  , its Twitter feed now headed by the words “Article 50 Now”. “Let’s be honest,” she insists. “Racism is mainstream. Anti-immigration is mainstream in our political culture. We have had a political rhetoric around immigration,  . “These people [being overtly racist] have been drip fed this.” “We need to take a step back,” she adds, “And ask ‘What sort of society do we want to live in?’” As suggested by the followers of PostRefRacism, the signs in Deptford, and the rally in Norwich, many people are taking that step back. Perhaps comfort can also be drawn from Mr Hamilton’s observation that in some countries, “Every third hate crime is a murder”.   In the UK, the violence - like that in Yeovil - has been real and terrifying, but the vast majority of incidents analysed by   have stopped at verbal, not physical abuse. But that, as Mr Hamilton rightly observes, will be scant consolation to the woman in Tottenham who reported a man staring at her husband and yelling: “I’m going to open up and cut f****** Pakis”; or to the girl in Glasgow who had her headscarf pulled from her head as she was told: “Trash like you better start obeying the white man.

" Investigation reveals ‘deeply concerning’ waits to see counsellors for struggling undergraduates across the country Students are having to wait for more than four months for counselling and   support in some universities, as   new figures show. Campaigners condemned “deeply concerning” variations in provision of care for undergraduates across the country, with waits of more than four weeks for treatment at 21 universities. Delays to diagnosis and treatment can lead to crisis situations among young students, who are burdened with increasing financial stress from huge debts and uncertain career prospects after leaving university, according to experts. It comes after a study by the think tank Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR) revealed that a record 134 students killed themselves in 2015, while the number of first-year undergraduates reporting a mental health concern rose fivefold to reach 15,395. New figures obtained through Freedom of Information requests to more than 100 universities reveal a postcode lottery of waiting times for treatment. One of the longest waits in the last five years was experienced by a student at Glasgow University, who waited 146 days for treatment. However the university stressed that there are many reasons why a delay can occur, including a student’s choice to defer their appointment. A spokesman said: “Our most recent statistics (1 August – 1 November 2017) for general counselling appointments show that 88 per cent of referrals were seen within three weeks, and that 55 per cent more students have been assessed compared to the same period in the previous academic year. Our figures also show that almost 40 per cent fewer students are waiting for assistance compared to the same time in the last academic year.” Other universities reported long waits including Sheffield Hallam with 148 days, 127 days at Southampton Solent and nearly four months at University of Exeter.  former health minister Norman Lamb, who obtained the figures, said it was “disappointing” that some institutions were lagging behind, pointing to figures that show nearly 60 universities have increased their funding for mental health provision in the last year. Mr Lamb said: “Every university has a duty to provide decent support to its students. Any that fails to do so must be challenged. It can no longer be tolerated. “Moving to university can be a particularly challenging and stressful time for many young people, with some struggling to adapt to moving away often from home, family and other support networks. “That is why it is doubly important that universities provide easily accessible support to those struggling with mental health conditions.” The analysis shows 58 universities having increased funding for mental health provision in the past year while 12 have slashed spending. Meanwhile 41 universities have cut the number of counsellors on their books over the past year. Rachel Boyd, information manager at Mind, said: “We are happy to see that some progress is being made to prioritise student mental health. “However it is deeply concerning that in some universities, students are having to wait up to nine months to access mental health services. “There are lots of different reasons why students might experience a mental health problem, but university life does pose some unique challenges. “Today’s students also now face an unprecedented financial burden with student loan and tuition fee debt higher than ever before. “On the other side of this is the financial stress and uncertainty around employment on graduation. Both of these can be major contributors to mental health problems like anxiety and depression.” Journalist Carrie Gracie speaks to the media outside the BBC in London after she turned down a £45,000 rise, describing the offer as a botched solution to the problem of unequal pay at the BBC.

" 'I deal with President Trump. What I see is somebody who is committed to ensuring he is taking decisions in the best interests of the United States'  has dismissed growing concerns about  ’s mental state, insisting she sees a man making decisions in the “best interests of the United States”. Asked if she believed the doubts being raised about the President's fitness for office were “serious” – following the publication of an explosive book – the Prime Minister replied: “No.” “I deal with President Trump. What I see is somebody who is committed to ensuring he is taking decisions in the best interests of the United States,” Mrs May told the BBC’s    . She also confirmed Mr Trump would be visiting Britain, but without revealing when, saying: “He will be coming to this country.” Mrs May faced the awkward questions after the book, by journalist Michael Wolff, claimed that White House staff reported having to treat  . “What they mean by that, he has a need for immediate gratification. It's all about him. This man does not read, does not listen. He's like a pinball, just shooting off the sides,” the author told NBC News. A clinical professor has briefed members of the US Congress on the potential risks associated with the  . Bandy Lee, of the Yale School of Medicine, who has studied how to predict and prevent violence, said she and other psychiatrists felt “the danger has become imminent”. During the interview, Mr Marr asked: “In the States there are quite serious questions being raised about his mental state. Do you think they are serious?” – prompting Mrs May to reply “no”. The presenter also asked if the Prime Minister believed Mr Trump was a “child or stable genius” – a reference to the President’s much-ridiculed tweets on Saturday. The President had attempted to assert his mental fitness, claiming: “Actually, throughout my life, my two greatest assets have been mental stability and being, like, really smart. Crooked   also played these cards very hard and, as everyone knows, went down in flames. “I went from VERY successful businessman, to top T.V. Star to President of the United States (on my first try). I think that would qualify as not smart, but genius and a very stable genius at that.” The 25th amendment of the US constitution provides for the removal of a president deemed unfit, if a majority of the cabinet and the vice-president agree. Talk that Mr Trump could be removed from power in that way has been sparked by ex-White House strategist  , in Mr Wolff’s book, referring to Vice-President Mike Pence as “our fallback guy”. Controversially, Mrs May invited the President on a state visit to the UK when she met him at the White House immediately after his inauguration last year.

" Senior Conservative tells  if this was meant to show she has the power to reshuffle her Cabinet, it has shown the complete opposite'  ’s bid to renew her Government with a Cabinet   fell flat on Monday after key minsters refused to be moved from their jobs and one walked out of her Cabinet. The Prime Minister had wanted to keep   in her top team, but failed to stop her quitting with the former education secretary rejecting a transfer to another department. Ms May’s authority was further called into question after Health Secretary   not only rebutted an attempt to move him, but managed to secure an enhanced role in his current post. One senior Conservative MP said: “If this was meant to show she has the power to reshuffle her Cabinet, it has shown the complete opposite.”   Changes made to the set up at Conservative HQ were at least well received, with new Party Chairman   and his deputy   expected to have a positive impact on the Tories’ campaign machinery. But the day started with a botched statement, naming the wrong person being given a top job, and was then characterised by a series of announcements confirming Ms May would allow people to keep posts. The Prime Minister had already conceded there would be no move for her most senior ministers – Foreign Secretary  , Chancellor  , Home Secretary   and Brexit Secretary   – despite talk last year that some might be transferred or sacked.

Ms Greening left Downing Street around 8pm on Monday night after a gruelling three-hour meeting in which she rebuffed attempts by Ms May to make her stay at the Cabinet table. The Prime Minister had wanted to move her from the Department for Education for some time, with Ms May’s allies claiming the former minister was disloyal and had not fully embraced the spirit of the PM’s desired reforms. But Downing Street also wanted to avoid the instability of a long-serving minister quitting and heading to the backbenches, where she is now free to join forces with rebels who like her voted to stay in the European Union. The plan was to offer her a job at the Department for Work and Pensions, but Ms Greening refused and had already made her intentions clear days before as she started tweeting about her achievements at the DfE. Aides said Ms May was “disappointed”, but respected Ms Greening’s decision to leave.   will replace her as the new Education Secretary. Ms Greening said on Twitter: “I'll continue to do everything I can to create a country that has equality of opportunity for young people & I’ll keep working hard as MP for Putney.” Mr Hunt also refused a move proposed to him and instead argued he stay in post at the Department of Health to fully merge the NHS and social care. One party source told  : “It is apparently just possible that Jeremy Hunt was speaking the truth when he said that the health job was the last one big job he would do in politics. “It seems that was his intention, and he didn’t feel leaving during the winter pressures on the NHS in particular was the right thing.” Mr Hunt apparently argued his case for staying so “passionately”, that he now takes responsibility for the drive to reform the NHS, gaining a new job title – Health and Social Care Secretary – and departmental name to reflect the enormity of the job ahead.  will also head a department with new name, the Ministry for Housing, Communities and Local Government, in an attempt to underline Ms May’s commitment to tackling the housing shortage. In both cases officials said the costs of changing stationary, signs, business cards and branding for the newly named departments would be kept to a minimum. Ms May had planned to move Mr Hunt to the Department for Business, where critics claimed Mr Clark had failed to live up to the job. But after being kept waiting at Downing Street, Mr Clark was told he would keep his post and will now push through Ms May’s pledge to cap energy bills. Another minister Ms May is said to have wanted moved,  , will also keep her job as Leader of the Commons. Looking forward to continuing working as Leader of the House                One Senior MP said: “I hadn’t appreciated that reshuffles were about people turning up to Downing Street and telling the Prime Minister what job they wanted. “It’s meant to be about the Prime Minister asserting her power, but it’s served to underline her weakness.” Another MP said it would not inspire people to think the Government had “renewed vision”, adding: “There’s not very much there which is meaty.” The Work and Pensions post was eventually taken by Esther McVey who wins her first Cabinet post, with the former holder of that role David Gauke going to the Ministry of Justice. Ex-Justice Secretary David Liddington moved to the Cabinet Office to take up responsibilities left by  , who quit last year following an investigation into breaches of the ministerial code. Mr Liddington will deputise for Ms May at Prime Minister’s Questions and chair critical Cabinet committees, including those on Brexit, but will not receive the prestigious First Secretary title Mr Green had. The day started badly when Conservative HQ announced on social media that Chris Grayling would be the new party Chair, only for the message to be deleted moments later. That job went to Mr Lewis, who with his deputy Mr Cleverly, will head a team of party vice-chairs designed to bring on new talent and show a fresher more diverse face to the Tories.  resigned from his Northern Ireland secretary job on grounds of ill health, weeks before major surgery for a lesion on his right lung, and was replaced by Karen Bradley.

" Controversial journalist resigns from higher education watchdog, amid a hail of criticism - just two days after the Prime Minister said he could stay   has quit his post with the higher education watchdog with an apology for his misogynistic and homophobic comments – just two days after   backed him to stay. The controversial journalist threw in the towel, amid a hail of criticism over his offensive comments about women’s breasts, gay people, the disabled and starving children in Africa. The decision is a huge embarrassment for the Prime Minister who cleared Mr Young to remain in his job at the Office for Students board, provided he did not repeat the offensive tweets and articles. , the Foreign Secretary, and Environment Secretary   were among other ministers who praised Mr Young and argued he was ideal for the role. In the Commons yesterday, the universities minister, Jo Johnson, refused to rethink the appointment, telling MPs: “We want to encourage Mr Young to develop the best sides of his personality.” But, in an early morning statement, the free schools champion announced he was standing down from the universities regulator - after just 8 days - because his appointment had “become a distraction”. Writing in  , Mr Young said: “The caricature drawn of me in the last seven days, particularly on social media, has been unrecognisable to anyone who knows me. “I am a passionate supporter of inclusion and helping the most disadvantaged, as I hope my track record of setting up and supporting new schools demonstrates. “But some of the things I said before I got involved in education, when I was a journalistic provocateur, were either ill-judged or just plain wrong - and I unreservedly apologise.” The resignation was welcomed by Angela Rayner, Labour’s Shadow Education Secretary, but she said it “cast great doubt on the judgment” of the Prime Minister, who had failed to sack him. She tweeted: “Then yesterday we had the spectacle of government universities minister defending his appointment in parliament, he had to go. Tory cronyism could not save his job...” A petition calling for Mr Young to be sacked had gathered more than 219,000 signatures and some senior Conservative MPs had echoed the call. Robert Halfon, the education select committee chairman who has cerebral palsy, attacked the “dark” and “dangerous” articles written by Mr Young in the past, speaking in Monday’s debate. “What I'm more concerned about is some quite dark articles where he talks about the disabled, where he talks about the working classes, and much more significantly in 2015 - and I have the article here - on what he calls progressive eugenics,” He said. And fellow Tory Sarah Wollaston said: “I'm afraid I feel Mr Young's comments do cross a line and are therein indicative of an underlying character and the kind of person that would tweet comments to a woman that talk about masturbating over images of refugees” However, in an interview on Sunday, Mrs May chose to stand by Mr Young, saying she had been unaware of his history of crude and sexist comments. The Prime Minister said: “Toby Young has done exceedingly good work in relation to free schools and that’s what led to him being appointed to the Office for Students. She added: “He’s now in public office and as far as I’m concerned if he was to continue to use that sort of language and talk in that sort of way, he would no longer be in public office.” Last week, Mr Johnson tweeted: “Ridiculous outcry over Toby Young. He will bring independence, rigour and caustic wit. Ideal man for job.” We use cookies to enhance your visit to our site and to bring you advertisements that might interest you.

" Change.org appeal for Free Schools advocate's removal from board of Office for Students gathers pace as ex-Labour MP victimised in lewd tweets brands appointment 'beyond belief' A petition calling for  to be sacked from the universities regulator has gathered more than 200,000 signatures. The Change.org petition passed the milestone as a former Labour MP who was the subject of one of his controversial tweets joined calls for him to be removed. Pamela Nash said it was “beyond belief” that Mr Young had been appointed to the board of the Office for Students (OfS) and urged the Government to sack him “immediately”. Mr Young has faced growing calls to resign over his record of Twitter postings - including multiple references to women's breasts. The petition, which says Mr Young is “entirely unqualified” for the watchdog role, has twice the number required for a cause to be raised in the House of Commons when organised through Parliament's system.  was forced to address criticism over his appointment on Sunday and said she had been unaware of Mr Young's history of crude and sexist comments. The Prime Minister warned him that he will be removed if he makes any more offensive Twitter postings. However, Ms Nash said his unsuitability for the role went beyond “the odd tweet or stray comment”. She told  : “It is beyond belief that he has been appointed to the board of the Office of Students when he thinks so little of the majority of those who seek a university education.” Appearing on BBC One's  , Mrs May said she was “not impressed” by the comments and that any repeat would not be tolerated. “Toby Young has done exceedingly good work in relation to free schools and that's what has led to him being appointed to the Office for Students,” she said. “When he was appointed I was not aware of these comments that he had made. Frankly I'm not at all impressed by those comments. “He's now in public office and as far as I'm concerned if he was to continue to use that sort of language and talk in that sort of way he would no longer be in public office.” Ms Nash was Labour MP for Airdrie and Shotts between 2010 and 2015, when she was the youngest member of the House of Commons. Mr Young is accused of making lewd remarks on Twitter about Ms Nash during a session of Prime Minister's Questions in 2012. Labour has stepped up calls for him to be dismissed, although Mr Young also received high-profile backing. Shadow Health Secretary Jon Ashworth said that she should sack him immediately. “These tweets from Toby Young are disgusting, offensive, sexist. She should show some leadership and she should get rid of him,” he told  Meanwhile, Labour MP Layla Moran told BBC Radio 4's  : “I think he needs to be moved on as quickly as possible, I think he needs to resign if hasn't - or un-appointed, however the process would work - he's not fit for purpose for this job.” Fraser Nelson, editor of   magazine, for whom Young writes a regular column, said that his record as a pioneer of free schools showed that he was the right person to take on vested interests in the higher education system. Mr Nelson said that Mr Young deserved to be judged by his efforts in more recent years to help others, setting up new schools for disadvantaged children. While he acknowledged that some of the tweets were “pretty awful”, he said that Mr Young had been the subject of “quite remarkable” efforts to blacken his name since his appointment was announced last week.

" 'Momentum’s role is about mobilising people, helping people to become active and reaching out to people who haven’t been politically active before' It is Sunday morning and an anti-fracking choir of elderly women are singing outside Liverpool’s Black-E community centre on the outskirts of Chinatown. I'm at Momentum’s festival - called “The World Transformed”, about half a mile from Labour’s official conference in the city - on the first day of Labour's gathering of activists, MPs and supporters. One of the women in the choir of about a dozen – dubbed the granny frackers by one activist – wails “Theresa May is a whore” as she pokes the air with her walking stick. “Guess where she’s an MP for?” another screams. “Maidenhead.” They howl with laughter. Inside the main hall, it has the energy and vibrancy missing from the party’s official conference on the Albert Dock, which feels more like a wake. But it is hardly surprising these activists have a bounce in their step: at the entrance victory editions of the   are handed out the morning after Jeremy Corbyn’s re-election as the messiah, with the newspaper declaring “He’s gone and done it again!”. The coffee is also £1.40 cheaper than what the suited delegates are paying to enjoy the vacuous displays of unity 10 minutes down the road. The leader himself made two appearances at Momentum’s festival. On the first visit he thanked activists for their “significant” contribution to his campaign. Holding a copy of The World Transformed schedule of events, he added: “This event here might be described as some kind of fringe extreme. I see the kind of discussions that are in this programme here absolutely central and mainstream to how people think and what we're trying to do.” But 69-year-old Maureen, a retiree turned Momentum activist, looks somewhat disappointed at the end of Corbyn’s speech. “I was purged and couldn’t vote for Jeremy,” she says. On sale at The World Transformed there are T-shirts bearing Corbyn’s face, with one declaring, “I still hate Thatcher” while another adds: “I’m the one the   warned you about”. Among the literature one book stands out above the left-wing columnists on display –  . It includes 50 poets on the “threat to planet earth, war and peace, bullying, Brexit, the age of austerity and Jeremy Cobryn”. One poem, entitled Corbyn Haiku, reads: “Jeremy is not a typical leader – one reason we love him”. Another by Abigail EO Wyatt added: “Someone crept in and lit a candle in our hearts – that someone happened to be him”. Staffed by a small army of 65 volunteers in their twenties (who I’m told were pelted with eggs as they walked down the road the night before) the festival hosted fringe meetings looking at everything from anti-Semitism in the party’s ranks, producing mock election manifestos and workshops looking at media bias and “how to make the left sexy”. One evening, back at the gloomy official conference, I am asked by a Labour MP: “How is it over there in cloud cuckoo land with the rainbows and unicorns?” However, 28-year-old Emma Rees, a former primary school teacher and one of Momentum’s national organisers, dismisses the comment when I put it to her as “a cynical statement”. “It discredits the very real experiences that lots of people are living through and I don’t think it’s rainbows and unicorns to actually want to discuss how we can do things better – how we can structure society so that it benefits more than just the privileged few. And I actually think that’s the founding principles of the Labour Party and movement, is to empower ordinary people and the decisions that affect their day-to-day lives, she added. Rees is speaking in the Pullman Hotel lounge – a usual gathering place for inebriated journalists and special advisers – shortly after Corbyn’s speech on the final day of the conference. On the Wednesday, however, the lounge appears to have been used for a gathering of the left. Across the room sits Jeremy Corbyn, deep in conversation with Jon Lansman – the architect of Momentum. Seamus Milne, the leader’s director of communications, appears from the lift with his suitcase. The shadow Health Secretary Diane Abbott is sat a few metres away with her political advisers. A phone on charge next to the bar rings – it’s Len McCluskey. It goes unanswered. If the roof of the hotel would have fallen through, Liz Kendall would be Labour leader in two weeks’ time. Momentum, as an organisation, describes itself as “existing to build on the energy and enthusiasm from the Jeremy Corbyn for Labour leader campaign to increase participatory democracy, solidarity, and grassroots power and help Labour become the transformative governing party of the 21st century”. But just days before Labour’s annual conference in Liverpool began Neil Kinnock, the former Labour leader, described Momentum to me as a “parasitic” organisation with its own policies and purposes, “leeching” on the party he had led between 1983 and 1992. “Obviously, they have no intention of upholding the wellbeing of Labour – they want to control the party, not advance the party,” Kinnock added. He was speaking after Channel 4 aired its exposé documentary into the organisation, set up in the wake of Jeremy Corbyn’s resounding win in the 2015 leadership contest. The   programme secretly filmed activists in the organisation during a six-month period and promised to reveal new evidence that Momentum is being influence by “hard-left revolutionaries”. But a fair amount of viewers were offended, not by the one or two Trotskyists shown in the footage, but the daring, flowery shirt worn by Momentum’s architect Jon Lansman. Zac Goldsmith, the Tory MP who ran a widely criticised mayoral contest against Sadiq Khan in London, added the programme “will only reinforce the view that the establishment wants to trash Corbyn. Suspect it’ll have the opposite effect”. He was certainly right. For the ardent Corbyn supporters at the organisation’s festival, all the programme appeared to do was bolster their belief that the mainstream media – the so-called “MSM” – is a hostile bloc out to undermine the leader. In fact, 29-year-old Oxford graduate James Schneider, one of Momentum’s national organisers, tells me that 1,300 people have joined as members since the   programme. Momentum now has 19,000 members. The tenuous link with Militant and Momentum and the idea the movement has been infiltrated by hard-left revolutionaries resonated little at the vibrant festival that was staffed by a small army of volunteers in their twenties. While the organisation undoubtedly has one or two fossils working hard to provide it with negative headlines, it was these young volunteers running the show at The World Transformed. Some of whom were using the sofas on the fourth-floor of the festival as their bed for the weekend – including the ones in the “press room”, which had more resemblance to a London budget student flat; dimly lit, and all amenities in six-foot by six-foot space. “You’ll find one Trot for every three nice people,” one left-wing columnist told me. On the final day of the festival they close the press room (possibly to allow a volunteer to catch up on some sleep) and I’m seated in Momentum’s makeshift press office. They discuss an article in the  , which focused on their recent announcement of Momentum Kids – dubbed the “tiny trots” by some. The piece declared “shock” footage of a child who, when asked “what is a Labour politician?” replied with “a lion”. Corbyn, meanwhile, was described by another child as “the king”.  The press officers seemed unfazed: it was greeted with laughter. I imagine the reaction was a little different the following day when Jackie Walker, Momentum’s vice-chair, appeared to criticise Holocaust Memorial Day for commemorating only Jewish victims. Filmed at a members’ anti-Semitism training event, she said: “In terms of Holocaust day, wouldn’t it be wonderful if Holocaust day was open to all people who experienced Holocaust?” Momentum sources told me they were “fuming” with her remarks but a decision, at the time of writing, is yet to be made on her position in the organisation. When I asked Lansman whether Walker's would remain in her position, he said: I don't know the answer to that. But one of the biggest issues facing the movement is how, and if ever, it will be able to properly connect members with Labour MPs – in a relationship that doesn’t centre on the paranoia of deselections. Interestingly, over the course of three days I heard more talk of such manoeuvres on the Albert Dock among MPs, rather than activists at The World Transformed. But that is not to say it doesn’t exist – while those at the top of Momentum have attempted to publicly disassociate the movement with such actions, it is clear that some of the activists hold the view that if an MP dissents against Corbyn, then they face the chop. One elderly activist, wearing a Momentum badge and finishing his cigarette outside the festival on the final day, appeared agitated over Labour MP Jess Phillips. “What I’ll say on the doorstep is ‘Jeremy Corbyn’s not on the ballot’. That’s what I said about Ed Miliband,” Phillips had told a meeting hosted by the  . The activist, stamping his cigarette on the floor, lowered his voice and added: “Don’t worry, we’ll get her out”. But Rees and Schneider are optimistic for Momentum's future. “I think actually there’s an awful lot of consensus within the party,” Rees said. “There is an overwhelming degree of consensus and I think the platform that Jeremy has set up this afternoon is something the vast majority of the party – both members and the PLP – can get behind. “Momentum’s role within that is about mobilising people, helping people to become active and reaching out to people who haven’t been politically active before.” We use cookies to enhance your visit to our site and to bring you advertisements that might interest you.

" 'The Ghanaian government should work to address the stigma that subjects people to violence in their own homes, the place where they should feel safest'  campaigners are calling for the decriminalisation of homosexuality in   after a new report found violence towards   people by mobs and family members is on the increase. The report,  , has revealed the retention of a  -era provision in the country’s Criminal Offences Act prohibiting and punishing “unnatural carnal knowledge”, coupled with a failure to actively address   and discrimination, is relegating LGBT Ghanaians to “effective second-class citizenship”.  The Human Rights Watch, which published the 72-page report, has also said LGBT people are continuing to be attacked by mobs or even by their own family members. For example, in August 2015, in Nima, a town in the Accra region, members of a vigilante group known as Safety Empire brutally assaulted a young man they suspected was gay. And in May 2017, in a village outside Kumasi in the Ashanti region, the mother of a young woman organised a mob to beat up her daughter and another woman because she suspected they were lesbians in a same-sex relationship. Human Rights Watch interviewed 114 LGBT people for the report, as well as representatives for human rights organisations based in Ghana, a Commission on Human Rights and Administrative Justice (CHRAJ) complaints officer, the assistant police commissioner and three diplomats. Although LGBT people are rarely, if ever, prosecuted under the country’s anti-gay laws, Wendy Isaack, LGBT rights researcher for the Human Rights Watch, said it directly contributes to the climate in which violence against LGBT people is common.  “Homophobic statements by local and national government officials, traditional elders, and senior religious leaders foment discrimination and in some case incite violence,” she added. “LGBT Ghanaians should have the same protection from the government as everyone else.  “And the government should work to address the stigma that subjects people to violence in their own homes, the place where they should feel safest.” Lesbians, bisexual women and transgender men are frequently victims of family violence, the Human Rights Watch found, with many being beaten, threatened and driven out of their homes. Russia’s antipathy towards homosexuality has been well established following the efforts of human rights campaigners. However, while it is legal to be homosexual, LGBT couples are offered no protections from discrimination. They are also actively discriminated against by a 2013 law criminalising LGBT “propaganda” allowing the arrest of numerous Russian LGBT activists.

(Picture: Purported Isis fighters in Iraq.)  LGBT people in Ghana say that the violence against them has been getting steadily worse since President Nana Akufo-Addo said in an interview for   that the law criminalising homosexuality in Ghana remained because he did not believe there was a “sufficiently strong coalition” across public opinion calling for a change.  Leading Ghanaian activist LGBT Mac-Darling Cobbinah told   the community would “remain resolute” and continue to “sensitise people to understand” LGBT issues.  “I think we need to employ a lot more allies who will speak on the issues and not hide behind screens as existing currently,” he said.  “Speaking out will help people know and better understand that humans rights of sexual minorities is not based on the type of sex people prefer but it’s instead about humanity and dignity for all persons. “I support any move to create a rainbow nation for all persons than to throw the few minorities out of their country of birth because of their orientation.” And one gay man from Ghana – who asked us to keep his identity anonymous out of fear for his own safety – told   the key to surviving in Ghana when you identify as LGBT is by “staying strong”. “Daily life for the perceived and known LGBT community in Ghana is characterised with a number of negative experiences which come from all corners,” he said.  “We continue to face a high level of stigma and discrimination from health facilities, family, communities, with pockets of people facing daily physical, verbal and emotional abuses – including injustice, extortion, blackmail and rejection.  “There is a fair number who also experience dismissal from work as a result of their sexuality, legal injustice, healthcare inequalities, maltreatment and neglect.  “Countless people have considered suicide, seeking asylum or total isolation as a possible solution to help them deal with their sexuality.  “As Ghanaians we need to start rigorous discussion around promotion of human rights [for LGBT people], redefining legal terms and, if possible, repealing laws that criminalise homosexuality.  “Whether we are lawmakers or ordinary citizens we need to come to terms and accept the undeniable fact that LGBT people are human being who belong to families. They are our sons, our daughters, our teachers and our pastors. They are human just like any other person hence they deserve to be accorded dignity, respect and love.” And one lesbian who also asked to remain anonymous said that the government needed to stop treating LGBT people as “outcasts in our own society”.  “We want to be free so we can stand tall in public and not deal with obstacles and harassment daily – this will make it easier for us to get an education, learn a trade, get jobs and be useful and productive Ghanaians,” she said. Homophobic sentiment is rife throughout the Ghanaian government, however. In February 2017, Speaker of the Parliament of Ghana, Mike Ocquaye, referred to homosexuality as an “abomination” and equated it with bestiality, calling for stricter laws against same-sex conduct. This is in spite of the fact the anti-gay law is inconsistent with basic tents of the Ghanaian Constitution, which guarantees equality before the law, respect for human dignity and the right to privacy.  It also violates several human rights treaties that Ghana has ratified, including the African Commission on Human and Peoples’ Rights, which adopted a groundbreaking resolution in April 2014 calling on African governments to prevent and punish all forms of violence targeting people on the basis of their real and imputed sexual orientation or gender identity.

" Rescuers say mother's account is far from unique as 2017 sees more than 3,000 refugees drown in Mediterranean Sea By the time   smugglers forced Marie-Michelle into a rubber dinghy towards Europe she had already fled terrorists, four conflicts, kidnappers, rapists and murderers. But it was the journey over the Mediterranean Sea that claimed her two-year-old son’s life, in one of hundreds of disasters that have turned the route into the deadliest sea passage in the world. Like many of the asylum seekers arriving on Italy’s shores, the 35-year-old mother did not set out to come to Europe but was forced to attempt the treacherous crossing to escape violence and chaos in Libya. She told how she begged smugglers to let her return to neighbouring Algeria with her son and daughter before they marched her to a beach at gunpoint in the dead of night. “They took us to a sort of hangar, I don’t know where it was,” recalled Marie-Michelle, a Christian from Cameroon. “They told us to get on our knees and wait. There were a lot of men with guns and Kalashnikovs, pointing them at us.” Smugglers were building flimsy rubber boats for the oncoming voyage, preparing to pack around 150 desperate migrants in each one, knowing they would sink long before completing the 300-mile journey to Italy. When the boat was ready, Marie-Michelle pleaded with a gang member not to force her inside but “he told me ‘no, shut your mouth’. “They were putting engines on the rubber boats and I just started praying – everyone was scared,” she said. “They said one boat could carry 100 people but they kept on putting more and more people inside, there were people sitting on each other.” Marie-Michelle, who did not want her surname published, said she carried her son and daughter as the boat was launched by a fellow migrant forced to steer the engine. They had no life jackets, food, water, telephones or means of calling for help when the water started coming in as dawn broke. The mother described how men tried to bail out the dinghy with their hands and clothes but it continued seeping in through poorly made seals, eventually causing the boat to violently lurch into the sea. Some migrants fell into the water and others jumped, Marie-Michelle said, adding: “They said they were going to die and preferred to do it by themselves.” Despite suffering from a fever, she managed to stay in the sinking dinghy clinging on to her children, until the remaining engine fuel mixed with seawater and started causing excruciating chemical burns.  Marie-Michelle was struggling to keep her crying daughter’s legs out of the water and made a desperate attempt to put her on a higher part of the dinghy.  “I gave my son to a man who was next to me, I asked him to hold him just for a minute while I moved my daughter,” she said. “I turned back and he was in the water with my son. I wanted to jump in the water and save him but if I did my daughter would die.

I had to make a choice, I let him die. He drowned in front of me.” Marie-Michelle broke down while recounting her loss at a rehabilitation centre for migrants in Catania, Sicily. She waited for two-and-a-half hours before being rescued and taken to hospital for severe fuel burns, for which she is still having treatment alongside psychological care. Her surviving daughter, Samuela, was playing with Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) staff in the sunshine, just young enough to forget the trauma. Marie-Michelle’s journey started in 2009, when Islamist militants from  invaded her village in northern Cameroon, kidnapping and killing her husband, father and relatives. She escaped to neighbouring Nigeria with a group of refugees but found the terrorist group, which would later affiliate itself with Isis, rampaging there as well. After meeting a new partner, Marie-Michelle journeyed on to Mali and found peace for a short time by starting a restaurant and having her daughter in the capital of Bamako. But then the country’s civil war “exploded” and they fled onwards to Algeria – only to be repeatedly turned back at the desert border until she gave birth to her son. As other women starved and died in the desert, Marie-Michelle was given a hospital bed for a short time until authorities threw her in prison – with her infant son – for being an undocumented migrant. She was eventually offered refuge by a local Catholic church and returned to her partner and daughter, but said her family was harassed by authorities and neighbours in Algiers who “didn’t like anyone with a black face”. “I feared for my children, they could not even go out in the street because someone could just take you,” she said. “I heard about a lot of people who made it to Europe and said in Italy you can find peace and your children can go to school.” Marie-Michelle’s partner refused to leave Algeria so she paid €750 (£665) to cross into Libya with her son and daughter, unaware of the violence and lawlessness continuing in the wake of its civil war. After a week-long journey through the desert, they were delivered to a militia by an Algerian smuggler who had promised the payment would take the family all the way to Italy. Instead, they were put in a desert camp “in the middle of nowhere” where women were raped, people were starved, children were beaten and men were forced to work at gunpoint as modern slaves.  Marie-Michelle was given only saltwater to drink, with her and her children suffering from diahorrea and passing blood for months as others fell ill and died around them. “They had no mercy, not even for children,” she said. “The Libyans forced my son to smoke drugs, a two-year-old child. They raped women in front of me, they took them away and brought them back, they gave them STIs.” She warned other sub-Saharan Africans, who make up the bulk of migrants now arriving in Italy, not to “even try” working in Libya or travelling through the country. “When you arrive in Libya, all hope is lost,” Marie-Michelle said. “You don’t know where your money has gone because the person you paid is not there anymore and you don’t know where your money ended up.  “You don’t know if they’re going to kill you, or send you back, or let you leave. There is no hope.” Authorities say Marie-Michelle’s horrific account is far from unique, following the  being run by Libyan militias who kidnap, rape, enslave, torture and extort migrants on an industrial scale. Luca Salerno, MSF’s project coordinator on the Aquarius ship, said rescuers are hearing similar accounts from Libya “more and more”. Days before speaking to , he treated a group of Pakistani men who were kidnapped and sold to four different militias in Libya and tortured for money, being forced on a boat when their families could pay no more. “Despite the winter conditions, despite the agreements between Italy and Libya, the flow of migrants is not stopping,” Mr Salerno said. “Before, people were going to Libya for work but now it is a lawless country and they are crossing the Mediterranean to escape.” He accused the EU of choosing to “hide rather than solve” the   by striking deals with the country’s fragile Government of National Accord and empowering coastguards to force migrant boats back to shore in violation of international law. In October, revealed that the   to free detained migrants to attempt the crossing for a second time – after beating and robbing them. Despite increasingly violent attempts to stop smuggling and fighting breaking out in some coastal hubs, Libya remains the dominant launch point for migrant boats reaching Europe. According to UN figures, 171,300 migrants mostly from Nigeria, Syria and Guinea made the crossing in 2017, with at least 3,081 dying in the attempt during the same period. On Saturday, the Italian coastguard recorded the first disaster of 2018, after finding the bodies of eight migrants in a boat off the coast of Libya.

" The so-called ‘Antifa’ are a radical political movement to combat fascist, alt-right and white supremacist ideologies. And despite criticism, activists say they're not going anywhere America is a country of violence – violence that has, for too long, been the dominion of the right. So says a burgeoning group of left-wing American activists who are ready to pick up arms in the fight for peace. “Violence is everywhere in this society,” Michael Novick, a member of Anti-Racist Action Los Angeles, told . “Poverty is violence. Evictions are violent. Police brutality and racist murders are violent ... the US is more violent than ever.” Mr Novick is an   activist – part of a loosely organised group of people who aim to stamp out any remnants of fascism in the United States, even if it means resorting to force. “Antifascists generally, and Antifa in particular, recognise that the battles – including physical ones – to defend human rights and human lives are taking place right now, not in some science fiction future ‘when the revolution comes’,” Mr Novick said. Antifa hurtled into headlines this summer, as they engaged in increasingly high-profile battles with far-right groups in Oregon, California, and Boston. In August, after Antifa turned up to protest a white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, they even caught the attention of the President.  They show up in the helmets and the black masks and they have clubs and everything – Antifa!”   exclaimed at a rally. That being said, the Antifa aren’t an entirely new phenomenon. The movement emerged in Europe in the 1920s, in response to the growing power of fascist leaders like Mussolini and  . According to historian Mark Bray, their tactics inspired much of the Chinese resistance to Japanese imperialism, and the Latin American resistance to various dictators. Antifa popped up in the US in the 1980s, in response to the growing prominence of   groups. They frequented punk shows and alternative rock concerts – where “skinheads” were known to congregate – and combated the groups’ racist messages with literature of their own. In the 1990s and early 2000s, they showed up at protests against globalisation and unchecked capitalism. Now, Antifa activists say, they are responding to a new wave of racist, sexist, far-right violence – one that is increasingly receiving protection from the government. Their view, as Mr Novick put it, is that “a new, more naked white and male supremacy is becoming the order of the day”. Statistics do show an increase in far-right violence of late. The Anti Defamation League, a Jewish charity, reported an 86 per cent spike in antisemitic incidents in the first three months of 2017. The Council on American Islamic relations reported a 91 per cent increase in anti-Muslim incidents this summer. According to the Southern Poverty Law Centre, almost 900 incidents of anti-black, anti-Muslim, anti-immigrant, anti-woman, or anti-LGBTQ violence occurred in the week after Donald Trump’s election. In March, a white army veteran   on the streets of New York, allegedly telling police that he hated black men. Two months later, in Portland, Oregon, a man began screaming insults at two black women on his commuter train. When three other passengers tried to intervene, the man  , killing two and injuring one. Amid this rising tide of violence, Antifa say they have no official outlet to turn to for defence. “Antifa have learned, and call attention to the fact, that oppressed and exploited communities and popular resistance movements cannot rely on the cops or the courts to defend us from Nazis, because the cops and the legal system are often guilty of or complicit in racist and sexist violence themselves,” Mr Novick said. The election of Mr Trump, meanwhile, convinced many activists they could take no solace in their government, either. “We have people in the Trump administration that are one circle removed from [white nationalist] Richard Spencer,” said James Anderson, a contributor to anarchist web site  . “The Trump administration has definitely given a cover to white nationalists, the alt-right, and neo-Nazis.” That sentiment hurtled into the national consciousness on one hot, August weekend in  , when hundreds of white supremacist protesters gathered for the “Unite the Right” rally. Protesters turned out in militia gear, carting guns, while counter-protesters toted pepper spray and water bottles filled with urine. As fighting broke out, police largely stood by. Dozens of people were injured in clashes between protesters and counter-protesters. One woman, 34-year-old  , was killed when an alleged neo-Nazi rammed his car through a crowd of counter-protesters. Photos from the rally immediately dominated news coverage. Past presidents condemned the blatant bigotry on display. Mr Trump eventually took to his presidential podium to denounce the “violence and hatred” at the rally – on both sides. Suddenly, white supremacists were in the spotlight, alongside their Antifa counterparts. And while many Americans were stunned by what took place, Mr Anderson says they should have seen it coming. “These [previous murders] should have all been warning signs, just like Heather Heyer’s murder was,” he said. “But for some reason an African American man killed by a guy in New York … somehow his death was not the same warning signal as Heather Heyer’s death.” He added: “I think that if people had taken these earlier murders more seriously – as they should have – that we could have prevented what happened in Charlottesville.” A similar feeling may be what lead more and more Americans to pledge themselves to the Antifa cause. Mr Anderson’s web site, which used to receive about 300 views per day, now receives between 10,000 and 20,000. According to NYC Antifa, the group’s Twitter following nearly quadrupled in the first three weeks of the year. These days, they boast more than 21,000 followers. And the re-energised Antifa aren’t shy about their tactics. In Berkeley, California, weeks after the rally in Charlottesville, some 100 black-clad Antifa activists turned up for a protest against racism. Videos from the rally show Antifa activists smacking Trump supporters to the ground, throwing water bottles, blasting pepper spray and even  . Asked about such displays of violence, a member of the Atlanta Antifascists told : “Extreme-right and fascist organising inevitably leads to massive violence, displacement and murder when allowed to grow unchecked … Self-defence by communities and marginalised people against threats and attacks from the far-right is 100 per cent justified.” That isn’t the view of many in the mainstream, however – including many self-described liberals.  , a Democratic representative from California and the minority leader of the House, issued a statement after the Berkeley incident calling for the arrest and prosecution of those involved. “Our democracy has no room for inciting violence or endangering the public, no matter the ideology of those who commit such acts,” Ms Pelosi said. A former Obama administration official, Andy Slavitt, called the Antifa activists “idiots” and “animals”. Berkeley’s mayor, Andy Slavitt, said they should be classified as a gang. To Mr Anderson, and many Antifa activists, such comments are the inevitable backlash against effective demonstrations of working-class power. “So much of the media is just terrified of anything that reeks of everyday, working class people self-organising,” Mr Anderson said. “The idea of antifascists actively engaging with the far right is very scary to them, because if they can do that in this arena, what’s to stop people from doing the same thing when it comes to evictions, or ICE raids, or mass layoffs, or stuff like that?” He added: “I think there’s a desire to really put the boot heel down as far as saying, you know, ‘You’re not supposed to really do this. You’re supposed to be passive and hold signs and talk to people in power’.” For the meantime, however, it seems the Antifa won’t be taking this advice. For some, violence feels like the only means of self-defence in an increasingly militant world. For others, the stakes of this fight just seem too high. “I recently became a great-grandfather,” said Mr Novick, whose own father fled the Holocaust to take refugee in the US. “I don’t want to see my children, grandchildren or great-grandson have to live in the kind of world my grandparents and parents’ generation faced.” We use cookies to enhance your visit to our site and to bring you advertisements that might interest you.

" What was once a condensed fire season has expanded as weather patterns change Most   are unaccustomed to white  . But shifting weather patterns have dusted the state with flurries rarely seen this time of year. “It looked like my front yard had snow on it,” said 67-year-old Ron Tito, standing beneath the scorched hills encircling his oceanside town of Carpinteria. It wasn’t snow but a coating of ash: a byproduct of the infernos that had engulfed hundreds of thousands of acres near Los Angeles – and a potential harbinger of devastation to come. “We’re about ready to have firefighting at Christmas,” Governor Jerry Brown said after surveying the damage. “This is very odd and unusual.” California’s history, seen from one angle, is a chronicle of natural disasters. The threat of floods, droughts and earthquakes hovers ever-present, and wildfires are a fact of life. But this year they have been especially destructive. In October, a series of blazes raged across the rolling hills of California wine country and into populated areas, killing more than 40 people, incinerating thousands of structures and likely breaking a record for fire insurance claims. In December, a time when cooler weather and rains usually mitigate the risk, hundreds of thousands of southern Californians have been pushed from their homes by powerful conflagrations – one of which, the Thomas Fire that had rained ash on Mr Tito’s yard, was still burning weeks after it ignited. It is not just a matter of scale but of timing. The state typically had a fire season, with the odds of blazes climbing in the hot, dry summer months when fuel is abundant and the conditions are auspicious for fires to spread. Firefighters and residents could prepare accordingly. That predictable window, experts say, has been thrown open. Fire season is starting to look more like a year-round threat. Christmas, as the governor said, may bring no reprieve.

It’s not spring, it’s not summer, it’s not winter – the southern part of the state is year-round in terms of wildland fires, and the northland isn’t far behind,” said Scott McLean, a spokesman for Cal Fire. While researchers caution against attributing any one fire to climate change, there is a broad consensus that warmer, drier weather is contributing to an overall increase in the frequency and severity of burns. “There used to be a much more defined fire season in California in the sense that you could reliably say, ‘we need to start staffing up by this date and we can start demobilising some of the resources by this date,’” said J Keith Gilless, chair of California’s Board of Forestry and Fire Protection. “When our rains start, in a typical year there was an average time they’d start in the fall and you’d have enough water and snow that the fire season was effectively over in much of the state. That just isn’t the case anymore.” Climate change is supplying the basic ingredients. Temperatures in California have risen over the last half-century, including in the winter. Precipitation has become more variable, evidenced by the fact that the state is still recovering from a crippling drought that left it encrusted in combustible dry brush – the type of “extreme event” that is the hallmark of climate change, according to National Weather Service fire meteorologist Robyn Heffernan. “Our fire seasons are starting early, they’re lasting longer and yes, we do believe that overall that is tied to changes in the climate,” Ms Heffernan said. “When we do get fires they tend to be much more active because of the underlying climate conditions”. With those conditions in place, when high winds lash the landscape – as they have in both sets of destructive fires this year – flames are able to sprawl rapidly and outpace firefighters. The trend is not a new one. According to research conducted by Leroy Westerling, a climate and fire scientist at the University of California, Merced, the duration of fires in the western US has increased more than eight-fold, and the number of days with fires burning soared from from 138 a year to 222 annually between 1973 and 2012. In other words, there are flames more often than not.  “If you look around the western US in the last 40 years, we see steady increases in the number of fires not just in forest but in grassland, too,” Mr Westerling said. “We see bigger burns, larger and larger maximum fire sizes, more severe fires, longer fire season, longer-burning fires.” But a recent spate of fires have underscored the new reality in California. Three of the 10 most destructive blazes in the state’s history occurred this year; 11 of the 20 worst have occurred since 2007. “In the last few decades we’re certainly seeing warming in the West and a lot of times this is associated with drought or dry conditions. So that combination makes the vegetation much more susceptible to burning,” said Tim Brown, director of the Western Regional Climate Centre at the Desert Research Institute. “We are certainly in the last couple of decades seeing an increase in larger fires and an increase in more destructive fires.” Scientists caution that hotter, drier weather is not the only factor driving more hazardous and frequent fires. Decades of focus on fire suppression have prevented the types of natural burns that clear out underbrush, leaving more fuel when large fires do start. And more people have pushed into wildlands with higher fire risk, with some 11.2 million Californians spread across around 4.5 million homes in more remote, fire-susceptible areas as of 2010. “Climate’s one piece of the puzzle, the fact that we have so much fuel in the landscape is part of the puzzle, the fact that so much of our populations wants to live in these beautiful rural areas is part of the puzzle,” Ms Heffernan said. Setting aside the complex causes, the end result has become increasingly clear to Californians. “It isn’t precisely clear what climate change is doing at this moment, what is the precise contribution of the warming climate and what is the natural variability,” Mr Brown, the California governor, told a climate conference as much of his state was ablaze. “But we know that the fires you’ve seen on television and which people experience in California now, as we speak, are what we can expect and expect a lot more of.” We use cookies to enhance your visit to our site and to bring you advertisements that might interest you.

" The bride describes the quick-turnaround wedding as a 'fairytale'  A couple got engaged amid friends and family and within hours were married after the groom had planned the entire event to make life easier for his bride.  Nicole Rios, nee Carfagna, has lupus – a condition with no cure that can be exacerbated by stress, such as that which accompanies planning a wedding. Her husband Danny, decided to ask if she wanted to have the wedding immediately at their home in Smithtown, New York, instead.  Ms Rios has undergone chemotherapy to help with her lupus and told the BBC that it has “been a tough time” for the couple with her illness.  “Stress is not good with lupus. I would have been sick the majority of the time, I wouldn’t have enjoyed it,” she said.  “What if we’d planned the wedding then on the wedding day I’m sick? So this took all that stress away,” the new bride explained.  Mr and Ms Rios were returning from a trip from Walt Disney World when she noticed their home decorated with lights.  adamoprisphoto.com adamoprisphoto.com adamoprisphoto.com adamoprisphoto.com adamoprisphoto.com adamoprisphoto.com adamoprisphoto.com “I thought Danny’s mom and stepdad had decorated our house for Christmas...But Danny took me by the hand and I saw a big tent in our backyard, with our family lined up outside it,” Ms Rios said, describing the scene.  All who were gathered thought it was an engagement party as Mr Rios got down on one knee and proposed. They were in for a surprise as Mr Rios took Ms Rios aside and said: “If you want, I have everything set up to get married”.  Ms Rios said she “didn’t need to think about it. Suddenly all my jitters and anxiousness went away because I knew I wanted to marry him. I just said yes.” There were already a tuxedo and wedding dress hanging up as well as a backyard tent full of guests and food. In addition, Mr Rios’ father was ordained earlier in the day in order to marry the couple.  The bride’s brother served as her “man of honour” as well.  Ms Rios said it was “like a fairytale” and that her wedding went “perfectly”.

" The President pledged to his voter base that he would expel the ‘bad dudes’, feulling an anti-immigrant rhetoric President Trump vowed to remove the bad hombres from the US, yet a Mexican official said he had not seen any increase of people being sent back across the border. Mexico's foreign relations secretary Luis Videgaray said he had heard of raids being carried out across the country by US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) but he had not seen more people being deported since the Inauguration on 20 January. […] as far as the numbers of deported people, we still have not seen any increase,” he told the Televisa network. Raids have been carried out, he said, in California, North Carolina and South Carolina, and warned that Mexican citizens in the US should not let immigration authorities inside their homes without a warrant. He advised that they do not have to speak without a lawyer present. Mexico has set aside around $50 million to hire lawyers for migrants in the US who are facing deportation. Former President Barack Obama deported a record 400,000 people annually early on in his presidency, but narrowed the scope for deportation later to people who were convicted felons. The scope was widened again by Mr Trump to deport anyone who is undocumented, has an open deportation order or who returned to the US after being deported. ICE confirmed it had carried out more than 680 arrests across the US in the first full week in February. Of the total number, approximately 75 per cent had criminal convictions, which means around 170 people were deported without having committed any crime. We're actually taking people that are criminals — very, very hardened criminals in some cases, with a tremendous track record of abuse and problems — and we're getting them out. And that's what I said I would do, Mr Trump told reporters at a press conference alongside Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Monday. He added: And I said at the beginning we are going to get the bad ones — the really bad ones. We're getting them out. And that's exactly what we're doing. The raids have been criticised by civil rights organizations as being unconstitutional and discriminatory. The Council on American-Islamic Relations and CASA, a Latino advocacy group, both condemned recent raids in Baltimore as ICE operatives appeared to target Latino individuals based on their appearance. As an organisation that defends and protects immigrants and people of colour we will not stand for unconstitutional attacks on our community, said CASA’s executive director Gustavo Torres. Relations with Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto have already gotten off to a frosty start after the latter cancelled his visit to the White House this month after saying he rejected and regretted Mr Trump’s insistence that Mexico would reimburse the US to pay the border wall, which could cost up to $21 billion.  Former Mexican President Vicente Fox said repeatedly that Mexico would not pay for the f***ing wall. Mr Trump has also threatened to slap US companies and products with a 20 per cent import tax, a move which could harm US exporting companies if Mexico took retaliatory measures. On the day he announced his candidacy for the Presidency in June 2015, Mr Trump said Mexican immigrants were drug dealers and rapists.

" Seems as if the President 'just kept repeating applesauce', says critic  has been mocked for appearing to struggle with the words to the US national anthem at an American football match. Footage from the televised National Championship game between Alabama and Georgia in Atlanta shows the US President mouthing the words to parts of the  . Critics on social media rounded on the head of state, saying it looked as though he forgot the lyrics to some segments. The national anthem has become a point of fierce debate after the US President repeatedly criticised NFL players for kneeling during the song in protest at the treatment of black Americans. Hours before the game, Mr Trump again criticised athletes for choosing not to stand. “There’s plenty of space for people to express their views and to protest, but we love our flag and we love our anthem and we want to keep it that way,” he told the annual gathering of the Farm Bureau in Nashville. Mr Trump stood on the pitch for the anthem on Monday night and put his hand on his heart as he sang. He cannot be heard in TV footage but appears to falter in the middle sections of the song, before finishing with greater enthusiasm and grinning at the camera. Writer Tony Posnanski   it appeared as if the President just kept repeating 'applesauce' during the National Anthem. Colorado resident Neal Rogers  , Trump spent months railing against black NFL players peacefully demonstrating during our national anthem, only for it to be shown that he doesn’t even know the words to our national anthem… that really just ties it all up neatly with bow, doesn’t it? The President received a mixed response as he walked onto the field before the game, with both cheers and boos ringing out across the stadium. Football fans grew disgruntled before the head-to-head started, after being locked out of the stadium in the rain as the US President arrived. Footage from outside the venue showed hundreds of fans waiting in the downpour, with a number booing Mr Trump's motorcade as it drives past. Donald Trump appeared to equate US foreign actions to those of Russian President Vladimir Putin, saying, “There are a lot of killers. You think our country’s so innocent?” REUTERS/Carlos Barria At the National Prayer Breakfast, Donald Trump couldn’t help but to ask for prayers for the ratings on Arnold Schwarzenegger’s show to be good. Schwarzenegger took over as host of “The Apprentice” — which buoyed Mr Trump’s celebrity status years ago.  Early in his presidency, Donald Trump reportedly hung up the phone on Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull after the foreign leader angered him over refugee plans. Mr Trump later said that it was the “worst call” he had had so far. BRENDAN SMIALOWSKI/ Perhaps one of his most controversial policies while acting as president, Donald Trump’s travel ban targeting predominantly Muslim countries has bought him a lot of criticism. The bans were immediately protested, and judges initially blocked their implementation. The Supreme Court later sided with the administration’s argument that the ban was developed out of concern for US security. Bryan R Smith/ After Hurricane Harvey ravaged southeastern Texas, Donald Trump paid the area a visit. While his response to the disaster in Houston was generally applauded, the President picked up some flack when he gave a speech outside Houston (he reportedly did not visit disaster zones), and praised the size of the crowds there. AP During his first-ever speech to the United Nations General Assembly, Donald Trump tried out a new nickname for North Korea leader Kim Jong-un: Rocket Man. He later tweaked it to be “little Rocket Man” as the two feuded, and threatened each other with nuclear war. During that speech, he also threatened to totally annihilate North Korea. After the attack on the London Bridge, Donald Trump lashed out at London Mayor Sadiq Khan, criticizing Mr Khan for saying there was “no reason to be alarmed” after the attack. Mr Trump was taking the comments out of context, as Mr Khan was simply saying that the police had everything under control.  Never one not to mock his enemies, Donald Trump mocked MSNBC’s “Morning Joe” co-host Mika Brzezinski, saying that she and co-host Joe Scarborough had approached him before his inauguration asking to “join” him. He noted that she was “bleeding badly from a face-lift” at the time, and that he said no.

He later deleted the retweet. Donald Trump caught some flack when he tweeted a video showing him wrestling down an individual whose head had been replaced by a CNN avatar. Mr Trump has singled CNN out in particular with his chants of “fake news”. Donald Trump’s firing of former FBI Director James Comey landed him with a federal investigation into Russia’s meddling in the 2016 election that has caused many a headache for the White House. The White House initially said that the decision was made after consultation from the Justice Department. Then Mr Trump himself said that he had decided to fire him in part because he wanted the Russia investigation Mr Comey was conducting to stop.  Just three months into his presidency, Donald Trump admitted that being president is harder than he thought it would be. Though Mr Trump insisted on the 2016 campaign trail that doing the job would be easy for him, he admitted in an interview that living in the White House is harder than running a business empire. REUTERS Donald Trump accused former President Barack Obama of wire tapping him on twitter. The Justice Department later clarified: Mr Obama had not, in fact, done so.  Reuters Donald Trump was never very happy about losing the popular vote to Hillary Clinton by 2.8 million ballots. So, he and White House voter-fraud commissioner Kris Kobach have claimed that anywhere between three and five million people voted illegally during the 2016 election. Conveniently, he says that all of those illegal votes went to Ms Clinton. (There is no evidence to support that level of widespread voter fraud.) Just days after taking office, Donald Trump’s White House issued a statement on International Holocaust Remembrance Day, but didn’t mention “jews” or even the word “jewish” in the written statement.  Donald Trump’s inauguration crowd was visibly, and noticeably, smaller than that of his predecessor, Barack Obama. But, he really wanted to have had the largest crowd on record. So, he praised it as the biggest crowd ever.
Relatedly, Mr Trump also claimed that it stopped raining in Washington at the moment he was inaugurated. It didn’t. The day was very dreary.
 Reuters Meanwhile, protesters reportedly projected the words F*** Trump on the front of the stadium. One Alabama player, identified as Bo Scarbrough, was also heard yelling 'F**** Trump' before the game. The Atlanta branch of the NAACP on Monday encouraged fans to wear white and wave white towels — a move intended to mock conservatives who call liberals “snowflakes.” Last year, Mr Trump described Atlanta as “falling apart” and “crime infested” after Congressman John Lewis refused to attend his inauguration.  After standing for the national anthem in the field, Mr Trump watched the first half of the game from a suite before leaving.

" Law firm wants to hear from people who have faced repercussions for violating Google's 'political orthodoxy' A law firm representing a Google engineer fired for faulting the company’s diversity policies is seeking other clients who have faced “discrimination” for their political views. Harmeet Dhillon, a prominent figure in California Republican politics, has agreed to represent former Google engineer James Damore. Mr Damore lost his job after circulating a manifesto arguing that the company engaged in “arbitrary social engineering” to promote employee diversity. Since his firing, Mr Damore has argued that he was singled out for his political beliefs and argued that Google employees with conservative views are silenced, comparing the situation to being a closeted homosexual in the 1950s. Google CEO Sundar Pichai said in a note to employees that Mr Damore had breached the company's code of conduct and perpetuated “harmful gender stereotypes in our workplace”, though Mr Pichai added that people “must feel free to express dissent” and that Mr Damore “had a right to express their views on those topics”. A post on the website of Ms Dhillon’s law firm, entitled “Have You Experienced Illegal Employment Practices At Google?”, suggests that Mr Damore’s case could be part of a broader legal action that enlists other frustrated Google employees. “On behalf of current firm clients, Dhillon Law Group is investigating Google’s employment discrimination against employees on the basis of their political views and other protected characteristics, as well as retaliation against employees for complaining about these violations of labor laws,” the post reads. It encourages responses from people who have been written up for “refusing to comply with the political orthodoxy” at Google, including by speaking out against “affirmative action” or “employment discrimination”. Ms Dhillon confirmed she was representing Mr Damore but declined to comment further on planned legal actions. Her firm is also suing the University of California, Berkeley, on behalf of college Republicans and a national organisation challenging the university’s cancellation of a speech by conservative provocateur Ann Coulter.

" 'You really can't imagine what had to be gone through when investigating this case,' says state attorney A HIV-positive former sports coach has been charged with sexually abusing 42 children, prosecutors said.  Carlos Deangelo Bell, from  , pled guilty to 27 counts, including   of a minor, child pornography charges and attempted transmission of HIV, state attorney for Charles County Tony Covington said. Bell allegedly carried out the offences between May 2015 to June 2017, and victims were aged between 11 and 17-years-old, the court heard.  Of the 42 victims, officials said just 28 have been identified. Police said he sexually assaulted the students without using protection, according to  , but investigators were not aware of any victim having tested positive for HIV.  “You really can't imagine what had to be gone through when investigating this case,” said Mr Covington, CNN  , referring to the hours of video that “nobody ever wants to see.” The 30-year-old was originally facing 206 counts but after entering into a plea deal with prosecutors, will only be charged for 27. One of the goals of the plea deal was to prevent the young victims from having to testify in court, prosecutors said.  He is due to be sentenced on 28 March and prosecutors have recommended he receive 190 years in prison for his alleged crimes.  Migrants in a dinghy are rescued by Libyan coast guards off the coast of Garabulli, east of Tripoli Reuters French President Emmanuel Macron observes a minute of silence in front of the plaque commemorating late police officer Ahmed Merabet to mark the third anniversary of the Charlie Hebdo terrorist attack, in Paris Rex  Nicolaos Solis from Greece kisses the wooden cross which was thrown into the waters by Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew I, during the Epiphany ceremony to bless the waters at the Golden Horn in Istanbul AP Women mourn the death of a family member following a landslide in Kinshasa.

" 'Policymakers might consider implementing universal background checks for firearm purchases and limiting access to firearms for people with a history of violence or previous convictions' Treating people for gunshot wounds in American hospitals costs about $2.8bn every year, according to new research. Nearly 705,000 people arrived alive at US emergency departments in the nine years to 2014 with 37 per cent later admitted as an inpatient, the study found. More than eight per cent died while in the hospital. A paper about the study was published just hours after   by a lone shooter, who is thought to have then killed himself, in Las Vegas. Treatment in the emergency room cost an average of $5,254 while inpatient charges averaged £95,887. However, more than half of the injured did not have health insurance so either covered the cost personally or failed to pay the bill. Writing in the journal  , the researchers said: “Firearm-related injuries for our study population resulted in an estimated financial burden of approximately $25bn in emergency department and hospital charges over the study period.  “Despite the high clinical and financial burden associated with firearm-related injuries, resources allocated to preventing them remain low.  “Future policies related to firearms should focus on better understanding and preventing these injuries.” They bluntly suggested it was time for greater controls on the sale of guns. “Although future research is warranted to better understand firearm-related injuries, policymakers might consider implementing universal background checks for firearm purchases and limiting access to firearms for people with a history of violence or previous convictions to reduce the clinical and financial burden associated with these injuries,” they wrote. In 2015, 12,979 people were killed in gun-related homicides and 22,018 took their own lives with a gun. The researchers used details about more than 150,000 patients with gunshot wounds between 2006 and 2014 as a representative sample of the total. The overall incidence of emergency admissions for firearm-related injuries decreased from 27.9 visits per 100,000 of population in 2006 to 21.5 per 100,000 in 2013, representing a 22.9 per cent decline, they found. The rate for men was 45.8 visits per 100,000 compared to 5.5 per 100,000 for women. The rate for men aged 20 to 24 was 152.8 per 100,000. Nearly half of the patients, 49.5 per cent, were the victims of an attack, while 35.3 per cent had been injured unintentionally. Attempted suicide accounted for 5.3 per cent. The researchers said their cost figure was likely to be an underestimate for the total healthcare bill, because of “post-discharge physical therapy, trauma counselling, in-home care, and lost income”. It has previously been estimated that gun fatalities and injuries cost the US economy a total of $174bn a year in lost work, healthcare costs, criminal justice claims, and reduced quality of life. One of the researchers, Dr Faiz Gani, of the Johns Hopkins Surgery Centre for Outcomes Research, said: “Much of the existing literature on firearm-related injuries focuses on pre-hospital statistics with limited data evaluating contemporary estimates for firearm-related injuries. “Until people are aware of the problem's full extent, we can’t have the best-informed discussions to guide policy.” We use cookies to enhance your visit to our site and to bring you advertisements that might interest you.

" The Canadian singer was outraged after seeing the controversial pho The cultural reckoning for retailer H&M may not be over after the company apologised for an advertisement that was seen as racially insensitive. After the clothing brand released a photo showing a young black boy with a sweater claiming the wearer is “the coolest monkey in the jungle”, several musicians and artists decried the “coded” advert and vowed to ditch the brand. “Woke up this morning shocked and embarrassed by this photo,” Canadian singer The Weeknd wrote on Twitter. “I’m deeply offended and will not be working with @hm anymore…” That message was accompanied by the image of the young child posing in a green sweater with the message on front. The Weeknd began working with the clothing brand in 2017 with a modelling campaign. The Weeknd wasn’t the only celebrity to push back against the clothing brand for the perceived racial insensitivity. Rapper King Push joined in, and said that he wouldn’t ever shop at H&M, “not even for T-shirts”. Others took a different tact to express their distaste over the shirt’s message. The rapper Chris Classic, for instance, quickly photoshopped the photo of the young boy with an image of a crown over the words, and added a king’s crown to his head as well.

" The memo caused national controversy about diversity within the technology industry as a whole , a former   engineer, has filed a   against the tech giant for alleged discrimination against him for his conservative political views.  Mr Damore and lawyer Harmeet Dhillon held a news conference in San Francisco and said the company discriminated against white men who held political views different from those of Google executives. He has been joined in the class action suit by another former Google engineer, Dave ,Gudeman according to the   filed in Santa Clara Superior Court in northern California. The lawsuit says: Google employees who expressed views deviating from the majority view at Google on political subjects raised in the workplace and relevant to Google's employment policies and its business, such as 'diversity' hiring policies, 'bias sensitivity,' or 'social justice' were/are singled out, mistreated, and systematically punished and terminated from Google, in violation of their legal rights.” Mr Damore was sacked last August when his 10-page internal memo criticising the company’s diversity policies - specifically questioning the biological capability of women to be in engineering roles - and has been unemployed since. The document had, according to Ms Dhillon, been with Google Human Resources department or “circular file” well before being exposed by Motherboard and then published in full by Gizmodo. Ms Dhillon said that “in California your political views are a protected characteristic” and that what Google has allegedly done to Mr Damore and others is illegal. She said during the news conference: “I don’t want people to get fired for their liberal views.” But, added that Mr Damore was fired within 48 hours of the internal memo leaking because a “mob on the internet” determined his views “unpopular”. “Many of our laws are drafted for the unpopular,” argued Ms Dhillon, who added that in her view Google thinks “the only way to achieve parity in the workplace is through quotas.” Mr Damore said he would open to going back to work at Google and it is his hope that the lawsuit “really help[s] Google [become] a truly inclusive place.” He also noted that “about half” of the people at Google who responded to an internal poll actually agreed with his divisive memo.

She said the company was not “uniquely hypocritical” and pointed to the recent Golden Globes awards ceremony and Hollywood in general as the “center of...liberal virtue signalling.” One of the other purposes of the lawsuit is to “push back on the one story of Google,” Ms Dhillon said. The company is currently handling another lawsuit filed by four former female employees against it for that “story” - that the company does not have enough female engineers and that there is a great pay disparity between men and women in the tech industry as a whole. The US Department of Labour is investigating the issue as well, though Google has said it has not found any pay or job duty disparities. Ms Dhillon argued on behalf of Mr Damore that it is “entirely possible for Google to hire a bunch of women and pay them less,” adding that it is illegal in the state to “reserve” jobs for women and protected minorities. Though unemployed, Mr Damore made the rounds on several news programmes in the wake of the leaked memo. He claimed on CNBC that discrimination at the company against white, male conservatives was akin to “being gay in the 1950s.” Google has not publicly responded to Mr Damore’s lawsuit.

Gavin Wright, Patrick Stein and Curtis Allen of Garden City,   are charged with conspiracy to use a weapon of mass destruction for their alleged bomb plot, which they hoped would inspire others to attack Muslims, according to a complaint. The men have pleaded not guilty. Attorneys for the three men recently filed a motion claiming the jury selection procedure was discriminatory because it “exclud[ed] rural and conservative jurors,” according to the  . Authorities planned to pull jurors from the areas around Wichita, where the trail is taking place, rather than from western Kansas, where the alleged plotting occurred. Attorney Kari Schmidt, who represents Mr Wright, told the judge that there is a difference in belief systems between western Kansas and Wichita. “I don’t think I can say it’s legally recognizable, but factually recognizable,” Ms Schmidt said.

Spencer Platt/ In their motion, the defence argued that pulling from more rural areas would ensure the jury represented a “fair cross-section of the community” and give residents of those areas their “civil right to serve as jurors”. They also claimed that jurors from the western region are more likely to be conservative – and to have voted for  . “This case is uniquely political because much of the anticipated evidence will centre around, and was in reaction to, the 2016 presidential election,” the attorneys wrote. The men planned to carry out their attack on 9 November – the day after the election – according to authorities. Prosecutors, however, argued that the defence was seeking to pick jurors based on ideology, which they claimed could open “a dangerous door” for future cases. They also cited prior cases finding that groups of prospective jurors defined by geographical location do not count as distinctive groups in these situations. Judge Eric Melgren pointed out that most Kansans supported Mr Trump in the 2016 election, and questioned whether there was a difference between jurors in areas that voted two-thirds for Mr Trump, rather than three-quarters. Mr Melgren took the issue under consideration on Wednesday. Investigators say the three men planned to detonate car bombs at an apartment complex and mosque in Garden City, specifically targeting Somalis and Muslims. They face up to life in prison if convicted. The trial begins on 19 March. We use cookies to enhance your visit to our site and to bring you advertisements that might interest you.

" The suspected gunman in a Las Vegas shooting that saw more than 50 people killed is thought to have killed himself before police Swat team officers breached the room he was in. Some 22,000 people were in the crowd when the man - identified as   -  opened fire, sending panicked people fleeing the scene, in some cases trampling one another, as law enforcement officers scrambled to locate and kill the gunman. Shocked concertgoers, some with blood on their clothes, wandered the streets after the attack. Paddock opened fire from his hotel room on the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay Hotel on Sunday evening at approximately 10:08pm The victims were across the street attending the Route 91 Harvest Festival concert when bullets rang out. LVMPD SWAT responded to the call, breached the hotel room and found the suspect dead, police said in a statement. At least 406 people were taken to area hospitals with injuries, the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police said. Paddock was not believed to be connected to any militant group, Clark County Sheriff Joseph Lombardo told reporters. “We have no idea what his belief system was,” Mr Lombardo said. “We've located numerous firearms within the room that he occupied.” People scramble for shelter at the Route 91 Harvest country music festival after gun fire was heard  People carry a person at the Route 91 Harvest country music festival after shots were fired David Becker/ People run from the Route 91 Harvest country music festival after gun fire was heard David Becker/ A handout photo released via Twitter by Eiki Hrafnsson (@EirikurH) showing concertgoers running away from the scene (C) after shots range out at the Route 91 Harvest festival on Las Vegas Boulevard EPA/Eiki Hrafnsson People lie on the ground at the Route 91 Harvest country music festival after hearing gun fire  A man in a wheelchair is taken away from the Route 91 Harvest country music festival after hearing gun fire David Becker/ People stand on the street outside the Mandalay Bay hotel  near the scene of the Route 91 Harvest festival on Las Vegas Boulevard  EPA/Paul Buck FBI agents confer in front of the Tropicana hotel-casino after a mass shooting during a music festival on the Las Vegas Strip Reuters/Las Vegas Sun/Steve Marcus  Las Vegas police run by a banner on the fence at the Route 91 Harvest country music festival grounds after shots were fired David Becker/ An injured person is tended to in the intersection of Tropicana Ave. and Las Vegas Boulevard after a mass shooting at a country music festival Ethan Miller/ Metro Police officers pass by the front of the Tropicana hotel-casino after a mass shooting at a music festival on the Las Vegas Strip Reuters/Las Vegas Sun/Steve Marcus A woman sits on a curb at the scene of a shooting outside of a music festival along the Las Vegas Strip AP/John Locher A cowboy hat lays in the street after shots were fired near a country music festival in Las Vegas  Las Vegas Metro Police and medical workers stage in the intersection of Tropicana Avenue and Las Vegas Boulevard South after a mass shooting at a music festival on the Las Vegas Strip Reuters/Las Vegas Sun/Steve Marcus  Sheriff Joe Lombardo (2-R) speaking during a press briefing in the aftermath of the active shooter incident on Las Vegas Boulevard EPA Swat teams quickly descended on the concert and the casino after the attack started, and officers used explosives to get into the hotel room where the suspect was inside, authorities said.  “What we are going to try to do as best we can is to get our first responders back on their feet and responding and conducting a proper investigation to ensure that we have the safety of this community at heart,” Sheriff Lombardo said.  Country music star Jason Aldean was performing Sunday night at the end of the three-day Route 91 Harvest Festival in front of a crowd of 22,000 when the gunman opened fire from inside the Mandalay Bay Hotel and Casino.  Aldean was in the middle of a song when the shots came rapidly: Pop-pop-pop-pop. Video of the shooting then showed Aldean stopping and the crowd getting quiet as if it were unsure of what had just happened.  The gunman paused and then fired another volley, the muzzle flashes visible from the casino, as more victims fell to the ground while others fled in panic. Some hid behind concession stands, while others crawled under parked cars.  In addition to Paddock, police said they located a woman who may have been his roommate — Marilou Danley, 62. Lombardo said they believe this was a “lone wolf” attack.  “It's a devastating time,” Sheriff Lombardo said. President Donald Trump has extended condolences to the victims of the shooting in Las Vegas and their families.  In a tweet, Mr Trump offered “My warmest condolences and sympathies to the victims and families of the terrible Las Vegas shooting. God bless you!”  The White House said Mr Trump was expected to make remarks Monday morning, though details were not finalised.  White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders said Mr Trump was “briefed on the horrific tragedy in Las Vegas.”  Ms Sanders said that “we are monitoring the situation closely and offer our full support to state and local officials.

" Republican Steve Alford, 75, opposed to legalisation of cannabis, even on medical grounds, makes claim that African American susceptibility to drug was reason for its prohibition in 1930s A white   state lawmaker arguing against the legalisation of any use of   suggested that it and other drugs were originally outlawed in part because blacks were “basically users” and “responded worst” to the drugs because of their “character makeup - their genetics and that.” State Representative Steve Alford, a 75-year-old Republican from Ulysses, in the west of the state, made the comments on Saturday during a public meeting at a hospital in Garden City.   first reported on the statement on Monday and posted a video of it to YouTube. Kansas is one of the few remaining states that haven't legalised some form of medical marijuana, including low-THC marijuana derivatives that can't get a user high. But the legalisation question has been percolating in Kansas in recent years. At the meeting, Alford referenced a time in the 1930s when marijuana was prohibited. “What was the reason they did that?” he asked a crowd of about 60 people, none of whom were black. “One of the reasons why - I hate to say it - is the African Americans, they were basically users and they responded the worst off to those drugs. It's because of their character makeup - their genetics and that. And so basically what we're trying to do, is we're trying to do a complete reverse of the people not remembering what's happened in the past.” Asked about his remarks on Monday by the Associated Press, Alford said: “I'm not going make any more remarks about that. To me, that's neutral. Basically, I got called a  , which I'm really not, and it's just the way people - the interpretation of people. To me, I'm trying to look at what's really the best for Kansas.” Migrants in a dinghy are rescued by Libyan coast guards off the coast of Garabulli, east of Tripoli Reuters French President Emmanuel Macron observes a minute of silence in front of the plaque commemorating late police officer Ahmed Merabet to mark the third anniversary of the Charlie Hebdo terrorist attack, in Paris Rex  Nicolaos Solis from Greece kisses the wooden cross which was thrown into the waters by Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew I, during the Epiphany ceremony to bless the waters at the Golden Horn in Istanbul AP Women mourn the death of a family member following a landslide in Kinshasa.

" Hurricane Harvey was the year’s most expensive disaster, causing $125bn in damage Natural disasters caused $306bn in total damage across America in 2017 – the largest amount for one year, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has  .  A trio of devastating hurricanes and multiple wildfires all helped contribute to the record-breaking year, raising concerns about the effects of future natural disasters. “During 2017, the US experienced a historic year of weather and climate disasters,” the report said. “In total, the US was impacted by 16 separate billion-dollar disaster events tying 2011 for the record number of billion-dollar disasters for an entire calendar year.”  Hurricane Harvey, which resulted in unprecedented flooding in Houston and surrounding areas, was the year’s most expensive disaster, causing $125bn in damage. Puerto Rico continues to be mired in a blackout following Hurricane Maria, which left $90bn in damage in its wake. Hurricane Irma caused $50bn in total damage.  The storms also caused 251 combined deaths, NOAA found.  Western wildfires, meanwhile, cost another $18bn and 54 lives, according to NOAA. This was also another annual record.  Other large costs stemmed from tornadoes, droughts, flooding and other severe weather events. As Congress approved massive disaster aid packages in 2017, scientists continued to fear that climate change could make future extreme weather events even more disastrous. But it is still difficult to know how much climate change should be blamed for disaster costs.  Migrants in a dinghy are rescued by Libyan coast guards off the coast of Garabulli, east of Tripoli Reuters French President Emmanuel Macron observes a minute of silence in front of the plaque commemorating late police officer Ahmed Merabet to mark the third anniversary of the Charlie Hebdo terrorist attack, in Paris Rex  Nicolaos Solis from Greece kisses the wooden cross which was thrown into the waters by Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew I, during the Epiphany ceremony to bless the waters at the Golden Horn in Istanbul AP Women mourn the death of a family member following a landslide in Kinshasa.

One paper   that climate change increased flooding by around 15 percent. The other   climate change increased rainfall by 19 per cent at least – with a best estimate of 37 per cent. But even with climate change, Karin van der Wiel – a co-author of one of the studies – called Harvey’s rain an extremely rare event, expected not to return for thousands of years.  President Donald Trump took to Twitter at the end of the year to cast doubt on the reality and negative effects of climate change. He appeared to be unaware of the difference between weather and climate.  “In the East, it could be the COLDEST New Year’s Eve on record,” he wrote. “Perhaps we could use a little bit of that good old Global Warming that our Country, but not other countries, was going to pay TRILLIONS OF DOLLARS to protect against.

" spent the day on Long Island with members of the armed leftist group It is 9am on a Sunday, and a group of radical leftists are gathered at a shooting range in rural Long Island having target practice. From a distance, it looks like a scene from any small, conservative town in America: A group of guys palling around in a snow-covered parking lot, taking turns firing down the range while swigging cups of hot coffee to ward off the cold. Up close, however, it looks quite different. The guns are not American-made, but Russian; forged in the Soviet era. One has a hammer and sickle etched into the bolt. The men are genial but reserved, keeping their distance from the other groups around them. And one of them is complaining bitterly about his coffee. It came in a Styrofoam cup. “What’s wrong with Styrofoam?” his friend wants to know. “It takes, like, 50,000 years to decompose!” he replies. The environmentalist’s name is Mike, a Long Island native and self-described Marxist-Leninist. He was born in conservative Suffolk County to a clerical worker and industrial maintenance technician. He says he grew up “dirt poor, and was radicalised by a lifetime spent thinking: “There’s got to be an answer for why this is so shitty.” One night earlier this year, after a couple of beers, Mike decided to find some like-minded radicals on Long Island. He posted on a Facebook page called “Long Island Socialists,” and heard back from the page’s administrator almost immediately. That’s how he found Redneck Revolt, and how came to be standing on the gun range that day. Redneck Revolt is a national activist organisation that advocates for the downfall of capitalism through the elimination of racism. Its founders believe strongly that working-class liberation can only occur when workers unite, regardless of race. So in 38 different locations around the country, Redneck Revolt mobilises poor, rural white people to stand up for people of colour. And yes, they carry guns. Indeed, Redneck Revolt may look like many other social-justice groups – its website contains frequent mentions of “trigger warnings” and “solidarity” – but it is far from it. The members of Redneck Revolt don’t want you to sit in a circle, hold hands, and sing Kumbaya. They want you to know you have an enemy – it’s just not who you think it is. In an open letter that the group frequently uses for recruitment, it urges working-class white people to “look around” and wonder: “Who lives in the houses or trailers in the same neighbourhoods as us? Who works next to us in the factories, or cooks alongside us at the restaurants?” “It sure as hell isn’t rich white people,” the letter continues. “It’s Brown people, Black people, and other working-class white people. They are the ones that are in similar situations to us, living paycheck to paycheck, stretching to feed their families like we do. So why then would we view them as so different from us that we literally view them as our enemies?” The message seems to be catching on. From the group’s humble beginnings in Colorado and Kansas, it has spread to nearly 40 branches nationwide. Members participate in everything from community gardens to counter-protests at right-wing marches. Some even try to find new members at these marches, in a process known as “counter-recruiting”. The group counter-recruits in many traditionally white spaces, such as NASCAR races and gun shows. The Suffolk County branch, to which Mike belongs, isn’t big on counter-recruiting these days – they’re getting enough interest as it is. Instead, they host potlucks with neighbouring leftist organisations and protest prison conditions with Black Lives Matter. Last month, they hosted a vigil for victims of the opioid crisis with members of the Party for Socialism and Liberation (PSL). They also grow their own community garden, and go out every Thursday to feed the homeless. But Kevin – another Suffolk County member, who sports wire-frame glasses and a short, brown ponytail – says they don’t consider what they do charity. “Charity is the lowest rung of what we do,” he told me. “What we want to do is help people organise themselves – reorganise the conditions of their lives, so they don’t have to depend on someone else for a meal.” According to Redneck Revolt’s mission statement, organising people also requires organising a defence of their communities. Hence, the gun range. The Suffolk County branch group meets up for weekly sessions at the range, the name of which they asked to be kept secret. They often bring along other leftists groups, like the PSL, the Democratic Socialists of America (DSA), or the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW). Mike says those are some of his favourite days on the range. “I think it’s very cool that we can bring groups together that normally wouldn’t have anything else in common,” he told me. “And seeing a whole bunch of leftists with guns is cool.” Not everyone thinks the guns are cool, of course. Redneck Revolt has gotten pushback from liberal groups who think the weapons sully their image. But the members maintain that the firearms are necessary to protect themselves, and the communities of colour they want to help serve. “We are willing to take on personal risk to defend those in our community who live under the risk of reactionary violence because of their skin colour, gender identity, sexuality, religion, or birth country,” the group’s mission statement reads. “For us, that means that we meet our neighbours face-to-face, and stand alongside them to face threats whenever possible.” This summer, the Suffolk County branch rallied to the cause of Keenan and Anthony – two young, black men who were killed in a dirt bike crash on a local highway. Witnesses said they saw a 27-year-old white man purposely run over the two bikers with his minivan. The suspect, however, was charged only with one count of reckless endangerment. He pleaded not guilty. Shortly after the charges were announced, Redneck Revolt joined the Justice for Keenan and Anthony Coalition with the PSL and a local Black Lives Matter chapter. The coalition lobbied the district attorney to upgrade the charges, marching in a protest that momentarily shut down the same highway where the bikers were killed. The charges in the case were upgraded to second-degree manslaughter and criminally negligent homicide last month. For some, this may be an even more confusing concept than the guns: Why would an anti-capitalist movement of poor, rural white folks dedicate so much time and energy to fighting racism? George, one of the founding members of the Suffolk County branch, showed me how he would explain the topic to a fellow working-class white person. “Say it’s a landscaper,” George said. “He’ll blame [his low wages on] Latinx landscapers who are standing outside the 7-Eleven trying to find work. I would say, at the end of the day both guys are trying to support their families. And it’s the employer who’s screwing you by hiring somebody at a lower wage.” The Redneck Revolt pitch is surprisingly simple: Both poor white people and poor people of colour are actually fighting against the same enemy – the rich. “With some of the people,” George said, “a light will go off.” Redneck Revolt is not, of course, the first group of white people to organise on behalf of people of colour. The group pulls inspiration from the Young Patriots Organisation (YPO) –  a group of white workers who gathered nearly 60 years ago in Chicago to defend the rights of poor people of all races. The YPO partnered with the Black Panthers in their fight for economic justice, in what came to be known as the Rainbow Coalition. While the group itself eventually dissolved, modern politicians of colour – from Jesse Jackson to Barack Obama – have used the moniker to describe the population that elected them to office. But the idea of an armed, leftist group also conjures up a more ominous association: antifa. The little-known phrase – short for anti-fascist – gained attention this summer when dozens of antifa activists arrived in Charlottesville, Virginia to counter-protest a white nationalist rally. Unlike many counter-protesters, some antifa activists came armed. A few engaged in violence. The back-and-forth between antifa activists and right-wing militias eventually lead President Donald Trump to declare that “both sides” were to blame for the ugly scene at the neo-Nazi rally. The statue of Confederate General Robert E. Lee stands behind a crowd of hundreds of white nationalists, neo-Nazis and members of the 'alt-right' during the 'Unite the Right' rally 12 August 2017 in Charlottesville, Virginia. They are protesting the removal of the statue from Emancipation Park in the city.   White nationalists, neo-Nazis and members of the 'alt-right' with body armor and combat weapons evacuate comrades who were pepper sprayed after the 'Unite the Right' rally was declared a unlawful gathering by Virginia State Police. Militia members marched through the city earlier in the day, armed with assault rifles.   A white nationalist demonstrator walks into Lee Park in Charlottesville, Va., Saturday, Aug. 12, 2017.

He spoke about loyalty and healing wounds left by decades of racism.  Redneck Revolt members also came to Charlottesville – and they came armed. Their presence at the rally made national news, including a Fox News headline warning: “The Left has gun-toting militias of its own”. But Redneck Revolt claims it did not come to Charlottesville seeking confrontation. According to a blog post on their website, Redneck Revolt members came to offer protection for the community and show opposition to white supremacy. Mainstream liberals, the members will tell you, aren’t doing enough of either of those things. “Any of the groups out now aren’t touching neo-Nazis and stuff,” George told me. “Because they’re either afraid, or they think that you – that [prominent white nationalist] Richard Spencer, maybe his parents weren’t nice to him and he just needs a hug. And that’s not the case at all.” The better alternative, George explained, is to do what many antifa activists advocate: “If [white supremacists] have rallies, you show up to said rallies and just let them now that s*** is not going to fly.” But Redneck Revolt does not consider themselves an antifa group. George explained the difference as mainly one of tactics: Antifa are willing to engage in property destruction, cover their faces in “black bloc”, and occasionally punch Nazis on the street. “We don’t do that,” George said firmly. “We do everything within the law.” Indeed, if Redneck Revolt is the revolution, then the revolution is decidedly chill. Members of the Suffolk County branch shake off their Sunday mornings at the range with a weekly book club, where they sip home-brewed coffee and discuss radical texts like  . The evening is consumed by a planning meeting, where they decide which charitable projects to take on next. This week’s meeting took place at Kevin’s house – an old horse barn that someone had turned into a one-bedroom, one-bathroom apartment. The tiny space was packed with books, on everything Soviet military strategy to modern nihilism. The walls were strung with old postcards and tea lights, and a fading evening light streamed in through colourful fabric scraps sewn into curtains.  Almost everyone at the meeting had brought beer. Mae, one of the few female members of the group, had also brought Taco Bell, and was eating it on the floor. The group spent half of the meeting just catching up; strong New York accents bouncing off the walls as they cracked jokes about their decidedly un-radical hometown. “I don’t think you have to have much skill to work at the shooting range,” Mike joked at one point, during a discussion about one of the surly rangers. “You just have to be a dick, and probably pretty racist.” Everyone laughed. The Suffolk County branch was founded this April, as an offshoot of a leftist reading group at Stony Brook University. That’s where George found two kindred spirits in his fellow founding members, Kevin and Josh. A lot of the reading group members were Bernie Sanders supporters, George said, but “we read Che [Guevara] and stuff like that”. The friends knew they wanted to start a leftist organisation on Long Island, and George liked Redneck Revolt for its strong anti-capitalist message. George is a Communist – a belief system he, like Mike, developed from living in poverty his entire life. “When I was younger, maybe 16 or 17, I thought if you work hard you can do anything, you’ll be successful,” he told me from the kitchen of his in-law’s home. “Now, I work 65 hours a week and I have nothing to show for it. If it wasn’t for my in-laws, I’d be homeless.” The soft-spoken 30-year-old, who sports “Guns and Coffee” and “AK-47” patches on his coat sleeve, admitted he was also drawn to Redneck Revolt for its emphasis on guns. But he and his fellow group members agreed that now was not the time to broadcast this to the larger community. “To burst on the scene like gun-toting leftists straight out of the gate would be foolish,” Kevin told me. “The most fundamental thing is healing the community and building up their power.” The focus of the organisation, Kevin explained, “always comes back to serving the community”. That’s why their first act as a group was to start the community food garden, the yields of which they donated to a local school and the anti-violence organization Food not Bombs. At that week’s meeting, the group planned how they would give back during the holiday season. They’d already started organising a drive to collect winter coats for the homeless. At this meeting, they decided to hand out the coats themselves, rather than giving them to a charity to distribute. “Take the charity party out and put the solidarity in!” one member declared. The room buzzed with the nervous excitement of a new, promising project coming to fruition. Kevin had moved on from beer and was handing out homemade moonshine in wine glasses – the only clean cups left in the house. The group decided it was time to edit their mission statement. Alex, an applied mathematics student at Stony Brook, played scribe, taking down the group’s suggestions from his perch on the couch. Under the “strategies” section of the mission statement, they agreed to focus on holding town halls, reading groups, and skill shares. They set a goal of working with the disabled population, the homeless population, and opioid crisis victims. Under the “objectives” section, Mike suggested that too many of their aims were focused on economic issues, rather than social ones. The group agreed. They added “break down all socially restrictive structures” to their to-do list. At times, the gathering seemed to be as much a support group as it was a planning meeting. The members revelled in talking about their radical ideas, bouncing them off of the few like-minded people who lived on the island. Before he joined Redneck Revolt, Kevin told me, “I felt isolated because I didn’t know any other real leftists.” “None of us did,” Mae added. But the group can also cause friction with the surrounding community. The conservatives on the island don’t like them, of course, but many the liberals also take issue with their tactics. Even the church they volunteer with on Thursday nights doesn’t like hearing about their socialist beliefs or their time on the gun range, George said. The name Redneck Revolt also rubs some people the wrong way. George described a comment war that ensued on their Facebook page, when a white woman suggested the phrase “redneck” would prevent them from reaching communities of colour. Other people chimed in, offering their criticisms of the group, until someone wrote: “While you were all fighting over how the name alienates people, Redneck Revolt was at the Riverhead Jail with Black Lives Matter holding a demonstration.” For emphasis, he added: “You guys are just talking about petty bulls***.” It seems to be that feeling – that ability to do something meaningful, in a world that feels stacked against you – that keeps members of the Suffolk County branch coming back every week. It may even be what motivates poor, rural white people to keep joining Redneck Revolt branches around the country. One of the youngest Suffolk County members explained that feeling to me simply. His name was Ben, and he had recently dropped out of college after the cost became too much to bear. He made a living stocking liquor store shelves, and then selling rare silver coins. He joined the Suffolk County Redneck Revolt branch soon after it started. “The very fact that you’re putting in effort and doing something, rather than sitting at home and maybe writing an angry Facebook post every few weeks – It just makes me feel good about myself,” he said.

" Ms Winfrey has some commonalities with Donald Trump  The   has said it welcomes Oprah Winfrey to challenge President Donald Trump for office, potentially setting up a tantalizing showdown between the two TV icons in 2020.  “We welcome the challenge, whether it be Oprah Winfrey or anybody else,” White House spokesman Hogan Gidley told reporters aboard Air Force One.  Ms Winfrey delivered a powerful speech on Sunday at the Golden Globes that brought men and women to their feet. During an impassioned monologue, the actress and talk show host discussed racism, sexism and the #MeToo movement as well as honoured Rosa Parks and the late Civil Rights icon Recy Taylor. “For too long, women have not been heard or believed if they dared to speak their truth to the power of those men. But their time is up. Their time is up!”  Ms Winfrey said, leading to a standing ovation. Her remarks have prompted speculation that she will run in 2020, and many on social media have begun calling on the TV legend to announce her presidential bid using the hashtag “#Oprah2020”.  Golden Globes host Seth Meyers jokingly forbade the 63-year-old from running for president, noting he did the same with Donald Trump in 2011.  At the event, Ms Winfrey said she had no plan to run for the White House. But her partner Stedman Graham,  Ms Winfrey is a favourite in liberal circles and campaigned for Barack Obama in 2008. In 2016, she endorsed Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.

Like Mr Trump before he took office, Ms Winfrey also has deep pockets, limited experience in politics and instant name recognition. They both also had their own television shows and worked to build their own empires. Ms Winfrey is currently the chief executive of the cable channel OWN, a “special correspondent” for the CBS newsmagazine “60 Minutes” and an investor in companies such as Weight Watchers. While introducing Ms Winfrey at the Golden Globes, actress Reese Witherspoon alluded to her friend’s supreme status: “There’s only one person whose name is a verb, an adjective, and a feeling. And that is Oprah.” During an interview with the billionaire and entrepreneur on Bloomberg last March, interviewer David Rubenstein broached the possibility of her running for president, saying “It’s clear you don’t need government experience to be elected president of the United States.” Ms Winfrey indicated a similar thought had crossed her mind following Mr Trump’s victory: “I thought, ‘Oh gee, I don’t have the experience, I don’t know enough.’ And now I’m thinking, ‘Oh. Oh!’” While the support appears to be broadening for Ms Winfrey's possible presidential bid, the next election is still three years away. Mr Trump has yet to announce he is running again in 2020, although he has already held multiple campaign-style events over the past year.  We use cookies to enhance your visit to our site and to bring you advertisements that might interest you.

" Fans are already pushing for a presidential bid in 2020 With the way   name is being flung around this week, you’d be forgiven for thinking the television star had launched a new show or endorsed a new weight loss product. She hasn’t. But she may be considering a run for President. Support for a possible presidential bid erupted after Winfrey's rousing speech at the Sunday’s  . The media mogul earned a standing ovation from her audience and a rash of praise on social media. After the performance, her longtime partner said Winfrey would “absolutely” consider a bid. But the former talk show host has also shot down questions about running for office in the past, leading many to think it's not on her radar. So will   be facing down a fellow television star in the 2020 election? Here’s everything you need to know. Winfrey is best known for her eponymous daytime talk show,  . The programme, which ran from 1986 to 2011, remains the highest-rated daytime talk show in American television history. It won the Daytime Emmy for Outstanding Talk Show 10 times before Winfrey pulled it from consideration. The media mogul also launched several spinoffs from her TV show, including a monthly magazine and hugely popular book club. In 2011, the year she took her TV show off the air, she launched her own television network: the Oprah Winfrey Network (OWN). AP EPA CHARLIE KNOBLOCK / AP AP Winfrey was born in a small town in Mississippi in 1954. She was raised by a single mother, the family was poor and has spoken openly about her troubled past. In a 1986 episode of her show, she revealed she had been raped repeatedly in her youth. Winfrey eventually earned a full scholarship to Tennessee State University to study radio and television broadcasting. She worked part-time at the local black radio station during college, and later became the first black female news anchor at Nashville's WLAC-TV. The budding star hosted several different local news programmes before landing her own talk show in 1986. Around the same time, she scored a role in Steven Spielberg's film The Color Purple, skyrocketing her – and her talk show – to national fame. Winfrey has hinted at running for president in the past: She recently retweeted an article calling her “Democrats’ best hope for 2020,” and said Mr Trump’s election made her feel more qualified to run than ever. But she has told interviewers she would never run for office, and played off her previous comments as a joke. After Sunday’s Golden Globes ceremony, however, a presidential bid looked more possible than ever. The 63-year-old gave a   about sexual harassment, saying women had lived “too many years in a culture broken by brutally powerful men” and that “a new day is on the horizon”. The speech brought her audience to its feet, and caused the hashtag #Oprah2020 to start trending on Twitter. After the ceremony, Winfrey’s longtime partner Stedman Graham told the   that she would “absolutely” run for President.       REUTERS REUTERS   REUTERS With the question of whether America could elect a television star already answered, odds of a Winfrey presidency are already looking up. The media mogul has the funding and name recognition taken care of, and she may also have the influence: One study found Winfrey was personally responsible for more than 1m votes cast for Barack Obama in the Democratic primary. Despite Winfrey’s popularity – she scored almost 10 points higher than Mr Trump in a favourability poll last year – most Americans say they don’t want her to run. The same favourability poll, conducted in March by Quinnipiac University, found 69 per cent of voters didn’t think she should run in 2020. Policy analyst Sean McElwee put the odds of Winfrey winning at less than one per cent, owing to her lack of political experience. “Democratic primary [voters] are far more rational than Republican primary voters, and want someone who can successfully navigate the intricacies of policy and balance the difficult demands of the broad coalition,” he said. Winfrey has largely stayed out of individual races, saving her endorsements for the most prominent, national campaigns. She was an early endorser of   in 2008, and threw her support behind   in 2016. She also endorsed Democrat Cory Booker  – a possible 2020 contender – for his first Senate campaign in 2013. She has donated to the Democratic National Committee and state Democratic parties as well. Winfrey has shied away from discussing Mr Trump since he was inaugurated, but told the Associated Press last November that she thought he had turned a corner. I could sense, maybe I'm wrong, but I could sense from Donald Trump's body language even when he came out for the acceptance speech, that brotha has been humbled by this whole thing,” she said of his election victory. She added: “I think it's a humbling process that now you literally have the weight of the world on your shoulders.” Mr Trump, meanwhile, has widely praised his possible 2020 competitor. In fact, he previously said multiple times that Winfrey would be his first choice for vice president if he ever ran. “I’ll tell you, she’s really a great woman. She’s a terrific woman. She’s somebody that’s very special,” Mr Trump told Larry King in 1988. Fast forward more than 25 years, and Mr Trump was still singing Oprah’s praises. I think we'd win easily, actually,  Mr Trump told ABC's George Stephanopoulos in 2015. I like Oprah. I mean, is that supposed to be a bad thing? I don't think so. Winfrey quickly shut down any running-mate rumours during the 2016 campaign, however, declaring on Jimmy Kimmel Live: ”Donald, I’m with her!” We use cookies to enhance your visit to our site and to bring you advertisements that might interest you.

" Court agrees to review Section 377 of the penal code which is a hangover from the British Empire 's Supreme Court has agreed to reexamine a colonial era law which outlawed sex between men, in a possible breakthrough for gay rights in the country. The court said it would reexamine the validity of   of the Indian penal code which bans “carnal intercourse against the order of nature with any man, woman or animal” which is punishable by life imprisonment and has widely been interpreted as a law against gay sex.  It is adapted from an 16th century English law and was adopted when India was a colony of the British Empire.  The court agreed to refer the question of its validity to a large bench for examination before October. They were responding to a case brought by   activists who said the ban put them at constant threat of arrest.  One of the justices said: “A section of people or individuals who exercise their choice should never remain in a state of fear. “Choice can’t be allowed to cross boundaries of law, but confines of law can’t trample or curtail the inherent right embedded in an individual under article 21 of [the] constitution.” The decision comes after the court ruled that India’s LGBT community    The judges ruled that sexual orientation is covered under clauses in the Indian Constitution that relate to liberty even though the Indian government insisted there is no legal right to privacy. Campaigners thought the ruling would pave the way for the repeal of Section 377.  Russia’s antipathy towards homosexuality has been well established following the efforts of human rights campaigners. However, while it is legal to be homosexual, LGBT couples are offered no protections from discrimination. They are also actively discriminated against by a 2013 law criminalising LGBT “propaganda” allowing the arrest of numerous Russian LGBT activists.

This is not a policy enacted across the entire country, although there is a prevalent anti-LGBT agenda pushed by the government. In 2007 a Pew survey established that 97 per cent of the population felt that homosexuality should not be accepted. It is publishable by 14 years in prison.

(Picture: Purported Isis fighters in Iraq.)  Section 377 was dismissed by the High Court in Delhi in 2009 but this ruling was later overruled by the Supreme Court in 2013 which said it was the responsibility of Parliament, not the judiciary, to change the law.  The law is rarely informed when it comes to homosexuality – the Supreme Court observed few than 200 people had been convicted of homosexual acts under the legislation in 2013 in a country of 1.3bn people – but campaigners say the act still gives people the power to blackmail LGBT people and hampers efforts to combat HIV/Aids. Some 1,347 cases were recorded under Section 377 in 2015 but most of these were related to alleged sexual offences against children.  LGBT activist Aditya Bondyopadhyay said the decision showed the court was reconsidering its earlier decision to uphold and was trying to correct it.  He said: “There has been so much criticism of the judgment, and mobilisation on the ground and acceptance levels have gone up by a lot, [despite] the conservative forces in the ruling party”. India remains a conservative society and there appears to be little political appetite to change the law.  The ruling Bharatiya Janata, headed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, is seen as hostile to LGBT rights and runs on a platform of Hindu nationalism which stresses the importance of traditional Indian masculinity.  But there are signs the country is changing as Congress, the main opposition party which ruled the country until 2014, has put the issue in its election manifesto.  Meanwhile, a survey of young Indians by the Centre for the Study of Developing Societies found 61 per cent still regard homosexual acts as wrong but respondents between the age of 15 and 17 were the most accepting.

" Bitter rivals meeting to discuss improving relations, strained over Pyongyang's nuclear missile tests in defiance of international sanctions  has agreed to send a delegation to next month's   in  , Seoul officials said. The bitter rivals sat for rare talks at the border on Tuesday to discuss how to cooperate in Olympics and improve their long-strained ties. The Koreas' first talks in two years were arranged after North Korea's leader  recently made an abrupt push for improved ties with South Korea after a year of elevated tensions with the outside world over his expanding nuclear and missile programmes. Critics say Mr Kim may be trying to divide Seoul and Washington in a bid to weaken international pressure and sanctions on the North. During the talks, the North Korean delegation said it would send an Olympic delegation, which includes officials, athletes, cheerleaders, journalists and others, South Korea's Vice Unification Minister Chun Hae-sung told reporters, according to media footage from the border village of Panmunjom, the venue for the talks. The South Korean delegation, for its part, proposed North Korea send a big delegation and conduct a joint march during the 9-25 February games' opening and closing ceremonies, Mr Chun, one of the five South Korean negotiators, said. He said South Korea also suggested resuming temporary reunions of families separated by war and offering military talks designed to reduce animosities in frontline areas. South Korea also stressed the need to achieve denuclearisation of the Korean Peninsula, Mr Chun said. North Korea responded by saying the two Koreas must try to promote peace and reconciliation through dialogue, he said. The two sides were to continue their negotiations later Tuesday at Panmunjom, the only place on the tense border where North and South Korean soldiers are just feet away from each other. A North Korean soldier late last year defected to the South across Panmunjom amid a hail of bullets fired by his comrades. He was hit five times but survived. The meeting began with an amicable atmosphere on Tuesday morning, with chief North Korean delegate Ri Son Gwon saying he hopes the talks would give “a New Year's first gift - precious results (of the talks) to the Korean nation.” Mr Ri's South Korean counterpart, Unification Minister Cho Myoung-gyon, said he also hopes they would come up with a “good gift” for people in both Koreas. The overall prospect for the negotiations was still unclear. The two Koreas have a long history of ending key talks without any agreement and failing to follow through with rapprochement accords. An agreement on the North's Olympic participation had been widely expected before the talks began, but the Koreas remain sharply at odds over how to improve their overall ties. North Korea is expected to demand rewards in return for South Korea's offer for family reunions and military talks, like Seoul halting propaganda broadcasts and scaling back or halting military drills with the US, observers say. Suspension of the military drills would be unacceptable for Seoul because that would seriously undermine the alliance with its chief ally the United States, which wants to put more pressures on Pyongyang. The North views the drills as a rehearsal for a northward invasion. President  on Saturday expressed hope for some progress from the talks and said he was open to talking with Kim himself. But UN Ambassador   later said the US administration is not changing its conditions regarding talks with North Korea, saying Mr Kim would first need to stop weapons testing for a “significant amount of time”. In his New Year's Day address, Mr Kim said there is an urgent need to improve inter-Korean ties and that he is willing to send a delegation to the Pyeongchang Games. He urged Seoul to halt the military drills with the US and said he has a “nuclear button” to launch missiles at any target in the United States. South Korean liberal President  , who favours dialogue as a way to defuse the North Korean nuclear standoff, welcomed Mr Kim's outreach and proposed talks at Panmunjom. Mr Kim quickly accepted. “As President Moon has said, the improvement of relations between North and South Korea cannot advance separately from resolving North Korea's nuclear program,” Brian Hook, a chief adviser to US Secretary of State  , told reporters in a conference call late Monday Washington time. “And so, we remain focused on our global pressure campaign. That campaign is designed to bring Kim Jong Un to the table for meaningful negations.” Mr Trump's administration agreed last week to delay springtime military drills with South Korea until after the Games. Defence Secretary Jim Mattis insisted the delay was a practical necessity to accommodate the Olympics, not a political gesture.

The International Olympic Committee said Monday it has “kept the door open” for North Korea to take part in the Games. IOC spokesman Mark Adams said the registration deadline has been extended and that the Switzerland-based committee supports North Korean athletes in the qualification process, while respecting UN sanctions against North Korea.

" 'I want to give people social and financial empowerment, so eventually people who want to come out won't be affected. They will have their own social security system,' says prince A gay Indian prince has opened up his 15-acre palace grounds to vulnerable LGBT people and is said to be constructing more buildings to house visitors. Prince Manvendra Singh Gohil, who is the son and probable heir of the Maharaja of Rajpipla in Gujarat in western India, will run the centre with his organisation The Lakshya Trust. The royal, who was ostracised by his family after coming out publically in 2006, started the community based organisation to support gay men and educate people about the prevention of HIV/Aids. Homosexuality remains a big taboo in Indian society and sex between people of the same gender is punishable by law in the country. The controversial Section 377 of the country’s penal code bans sexual activity that is “against the order of nature” and many have interpreted the wording to include gay sex. Speaking to the  , the prince said he was keen to empower people with the social security system they need to ensure they are not left with nothing if their families disown them after coming out. If I could undergo these problems then any other gay person could face a similar situation,” he said. In India, we have a family system and we are mentally conditioned to be with our parents. The moment you try to come out you are told you will be thrown out and society will boycott you. You become a social outcast. A lot of people are financially dependent on their parents. I want to give people social and financial empowerment, so eventually people who want to come out won't be affected. They will have their own social security system. It won't make a difference if they are disinherited. The prince’s coming out was breaking news all over India at the time and resulted in effigies of him being burned in his home state and people calling for him to be denied his title. On top of this, he was disowned and disinherited by his parents.  Since then he has been the subject of BBC series  – a 2009 reality TV show which took three royals from their respective cultures and put them in Brighton where they were forced to “live and date”. Prince Manvendra's charity provides counselling, clinical services and support groups to thousands of men who have sex with men. Many of the men in question have yielded to cultural burdens to marry women despite their sexuality.  The prince himself was forced into marriage in 1991 but has since said the relationship was a total disaster. It resulted in divorce the following year.  Prince Manvendra, who had a highly traditional and conservative upbringing, appeared as a guest on   back in 2007. He was one of three persons featured on the show titled “Gay Around the World”, saying he does not regret coming out and that he thinks the people living in his state admire him for the leading role he has taken in preventing and educating about HIV/Aids. Last summer, India’s Supreme Court issued a historic ruling confirming the right of the country’s LGBT people to express their sexuality without discrimination.  Judges in India ruled sexual orientation is covered under clauses in the Indian Constitution that link to liberty in spite of the government claiming there was no legal right to privacy. The ruling leads the way for discriminatory practices against LGBT people in the country to be challenged in the courts.

" ‘The whole essence of our humanity is being reduced to nothing’ Free West Papua campaign leader Benny Wenda said In  , simply raising the Morning Star flag – a symbol of the island’s fight for independence from Indonesia – can result in 15 years of imprisonment.  But more than 12,000 kilometres away in the UK, the forbidden flag was raised this morning outside Oxford’s town hall for the tenth year in a row.  Oxford is one of more than 250 locations across 50 countries worldwide expected to raise the Morning Star flag today in a show of solidarity with tens of thousands of West Papuans calling for international intervention in the fight for independence from Indonesia.  “In West Papua, the whole essence of our humanity is being reduced to nothing. We are treated like animals and endure what some have described as an ‘apartheid-like’ military occupation,” exiled Free West Papua campaign leader Benny Wenda, who was granted political asylum in the UK in the early 2000s, and lives in Oxford, told  “Tens of thousands of us have been forced to flee as refugees and those that stay live under constant terror. Almost every day, people are arrested without reason, tortured and killed at the hands of the Indonesian government.” An undated   published on the UNHCR website states that Papua New Guinea alone has taken in as many as 10,000 refugees from West Papua since 1985.  Today’s flag-raising protests come two months after a petition that gained over 1.8 million signatures – more than 70 per cent of West Papua’s population – was presented to the United Nations, calling on the organisation to investigate human rights abuses on the island.  It also demanded that the UN’s Decolonisation Committee (C-24) put West Papua back on its agenda to “ensure their right to self-determination ... is respected by holding an internationally supervised vote”. “Carrying out [the petition] took months of dedicated hard work and commitment after years of planning,” Mr Wenda said.  “It was also incredibly dangerous because the Indonesian government immediately banned the petition and stated that anyone who signed it would be arrested.” The Free West Papua campaign claims that 57 people were arrested by the Indonesian military for supporting the appeal. The petition was rejected by the C-24 however, with its chair, Rafael Ramírez,  no petition regarding West Papua could be accepted due to the committee’s mandate being extended exclusively to the 17 states identified by the UN as “non-self-governing territories”.  “West Papua is not a matter for the C-24,” Mr Ramírez said. “We are just working on the countries that are part of the list of non-self-governing territories. That list is issued by the general assembly.” “One of the principles of our movement is to defend the sovereignty and the full integrity of the territory of our members. We are not going to do anything against Indonesia as a C-24.” The C-24 did not immediately respond to a request for comment from  and the United Nations High Commission for Refugees said it could not comment on decisions made by other UN bodies.  West Papuans have been calling on the United Nations to intervene in what has been called a “slow-moving genocide” for decades, as the Indonesian military continues to occupy the Asian island. The province was once on the committee’s agenda, when it was a Dutch colony known as Netherlands New Guinea, but it was taken off the list in 1963 when the territory was annexed by Indonesia.  In 1969, an Act of Free Choice referendum meant to decide whether West Papua would join Indonesia or become independent was supervised by the UN. However, researchers at Australia’s Griffith University   that less than 1 per cent of the West Papuan population was selected by the Indonesian government to represent the entire territory and that those representatives were “coerced to vote for the official integration of West Papua into Indonesia”.  They estimate that in the last 50 years, more than 500,000 people have been killed in West Papua as a result of the Indonesian government’s occupation, calling the situation in Indonesia a “slow-moving genocide”. Amnesty International and Human Rights watch have also put the death toll at 500,000.  “No one knows if they are going to be the next person killed, but every West Papuan person can tell you about family members who have been,” Mr Wenda said. “As a child, I remember the Indonesian military bombing my village and in front of my eyes they raped my aunties and beat up my mother just because she didn’t have an ID card.” “The Indonesian government has been able to keep this very quiet and so West Papua has been one of the forgotten stories in the world,” human rights lawyer Melinda Janki said.  Ms Janki says she learned of West Papua’s plight after she was approached by Mr Wenda a decade ago for legal advice.  “This violation of the people’s rights to self-determination seems to have been completely forgotten.  “It all sort of culminated in 1969 in what the Indonesians have called the ‘Act of Free Choice’, but which was really an exercise in which they brought 1,022 people together and basically forced them at gunpoint to say that they wanted to remain as Indonesian, so there really are not grounds for saying that this was a genuine act of self-determination.  “That was in 1969 and nearly 50 years later this issue continues to be buried,” Ms Janki continued. “I think it’s been an enormous failure on the part of the United Nations and I think the General Assembly spectacularly failed to take into account the rights of the West Papuans.” The UK’s parliamentary group on West Papua has called Indonesia’s presence in West Papua an “illegal occupation” based on a “sham referendum”.  “Put simply, it’s an illegal occupation. Promised its original independence from the Dutch in 1962, West Papua’s incorporation into Indonesia followed in 1969 after what was widely acknowledged to be a sham referendum, engineered by the economic interest of the Indonesia government,” Labour MP Alex Sobel told  “The colonised territory is rich in gold, copper, natural gas, forests and fisheries from which the indigenous population see very little, to no benefit.” He continued: “The UN will not be able to avoid this issue forever and as [the Free West Papua campaign’s] petition proves, the West Papuan people refuse to be silenced,” adding: “Quite simply, it’s an unacceptable part of the UN’s history that must now be put right.” Melanesian leaders have also accused the United Nations of turning a “deaf ear” to human rights abuses in West Papua.  The Prime Ministers of the Solomon Islands and Vanuatu called on the UN’s Human Rights Council to launch a formal investigation into human rights abuses in the province at the UN General Assembly in New York in September. Vanuatu Prime Minister Charlot Salwai told the assembly: “For half a century now the international community has been witnessing a gamut of torture, murder, exploitation, sexual violence and arbitrary detention inflicted on the nationals of West Papua, perpetrated by Indonesia, but the international community has turned a deaf ear to the appeals for help. We urge the Human Rights Council to investigate these cases.” “We also call on our counterparts throughout the world to support the legal right of West Papua to self-determination and to jointly with Indonesia put an end to all kinds of violence and find common ground with the nationals to facilitate putting together a process which will enable them to freely express their choice.” A spokesperson from the Indonesian Embassy in the UK told  “We categorically reject allegations concerning the 'slow moving genocide' or any other jargon to exaggerate the human rights situation in Papua.  “In fact, promotion and protection of human rights have been one of the most important elements in Indonesia since we became a democracy in 1998. The government is working together with our national human rights institution, or the National Commission on Human Rights, and has established working groups to resolve past human rights issues in Papua and West Papua Provinces.  “While we continue to resolve those issues, one should not forget that human rights also include right to education, right to health, as well as right to adequate standards of living. President Jokowi [Joko Widodo] is putting efforts to make sure the people of Papua now gain access to much needed education and healthcare services.” The spokesperson added that Indonesia has seen a general hike in economic growth from 3.6 per cent in 2014 to 9.2 per cent in 2016 in Papua and West Papua.  Migrants in a dinghy are rescued by Libyan coast guards off the coast of Garabulli, east of Tripoli Reuters French President Emmanuel Macron observes a minute of silence in front of the plaque commemorating late police officer Ahmed Merabet to mark the third anniversary of the Charlie Hebdo terrorist attack, in Paris Rex  Nicolaos Solis from Greece kisses the wooden cross which was thrown into the waters by Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew I, during the Epiphany ceremony to bless the waters at the Golden Horn in Istanbul AP Women mourn the death of a family member following a landslide in Kinshasa.

" Indonesian police seized the headquarters of the independence movement in the province of West Papua yesterday, the day after eight people were killed in battles between security forces and local rebels armed with bows and arrows. Indonesian police seized the headquarters of the independence movement in the province of West Papua yesterday, the day after eight people were killed in battles between security forces and local rebels armed with bows and arrows. The killings took place on Saturday in the town of Merauke, a few miles from the international border with Papua New Guinea, after police pulled down the Morning Star flag, which West Papuans regard as a symbol of their illegally occupied state. Seven of the dead were Papuans shot by police bullets; the eighth victim died from an arrow wound. A few hours later, in the early hours of yesterday, some 50 people were arrested in the provincial capital, Jayapura, when police raided the culture centre where the Papua Taskforce has its headquarters. It was the largest in a series of recent arrests of pro-independence activists, who have been escalating their activities in the face of increased opposition by the Indonesian authorities. Last Friday was the 39th anniversary of an independence declaration by Papuan leaders in the cultural centre building. The declaration was not acknowledged internationally and eight years later, West Papua, formerly controlled by the Dutch, was incorporated into Indonesia after a so-called act of free choice by an assembly of chieftains hand-picked by Jakarta. More than 60 people have been arrested in the last five days. Witnesses in Jayapura said a number of those detained were covered in blood, after apparently being beaten with police truncheons. We have to be tough but professional in persuading the Papuans not to raisetheir flags, said the provinical police chief, Brigadier-General Sylvanus Wenas.

" What you need to know about Hanukkah - also known as Chanukah and the festival of lights. The spelling differs as it's a translation of a Hebrew word. They say every major Jewish holiday can be summed up by the following quote: 'They tried to kill us, we won, let's eat.' In the case of  , the story is that of the Maccabees, a guerrilla army of Jewish rebels based in Israel who revolted against the Seleucid Greek King Antiochus who had - as the saying goes - tried to kill us. The exact historical truth of the religious version of events is disputed, but we do know that King Antiochus and the Maccabees existed. What is less established is whether the miracle described in the Hanukkah story really happened. Jewish people are taught that the oppressed Maccabees somehow defeated Antiochus' mighty troops and reclaimed the Temple in Jerusalem. To celebrate, they attempted a ritual lighting of a seven-pronged Menorah candle - but they only had enough oil to last one day. Miraculously, the oil lasted a full eight days, giving Jews enough time to procure new oil. This is why Hanukkah is known as the festival of lights. Around 2,000 years on, Jewish people celebrate Hanukkah by lighting their Menorah every night for eight days - with the crucial difference being that modern Menorahs - also known as Hanukkiahs - have eight prongs with a large prong, known as a shamash, in the middle. The shamash is used to light one extra candle each night for the eight days. Observing in public is a key part of celebrating the festival. Jewish people are encouraged to place the Menorah in the front window of their home, and some organisations have organised public Menorah lightings.  A modern menorah with seven prongs   Now for the most important part, the food. The story of Hanukkah is about oil, so it's traditional to eat fried goods such as potato latke pancakes or doughnuts.  Because the festival normally falls in December (although there are no guarantees with the Jewish lunisolar calendar), Hanukkah is often known as Jewish Christmas . While gift giving doesn't have any religious significance on Hanukkah, a tradition has developed to give presents during the festival - normally one for every night - possibly because of where it falls in the calendar. In 2017 the celebration begins on December 12 and ends on December 20.  Here are five facts you may not know about the festival: Unlike other major Jewish holidays, Hanukkah is not mentioned in the Hebrew Bible.   To commemorate the miracle of the burning lamp, Jews customarily eat foods fried in oil and this means doughnuts. ​ Chocolate coins or gelt (Yiddish for money) wrapped in gold and silver are exchanged at Hanukkah. Gelt is also used in a game played with a spinning top called a dreidel at Hanukkah. Players sit in a circle and put a chocolate coin in the middle. Each person takes a turn at spinning the cube-shaped dreidel, which has a Hebrew letter on each side. Traditionally Jews only exchanged gifts on Purim, a Jewish holiday commemorating the time when the Jewish people living in Persia were saved from extermination by a young woman called Esther. However, when Christmas became more prominent in the late 19th century and the Christian holiday’s consumerism grew, the Jewish custom shifted in imitation of Christmas.

" ‘It is not our job to police Facebook’s pages,’ International Organisation for Migration spokesman Leonard Doyle said The United Nations’ migration agency is calling on social media giants to do more to crack down on people smugglers using their platforms to lure West African migrants to  .   (IOM) spokesman Leonard Doyle said smugglers often use Facebook to make illicit deals to take would-be migrants to Libya, where they face the possibility of detention, torture and slavery.  He said young West Africans are especially vulnerable to being lured by smugglers, who often attract them with “false promises” of jobs in  .   “We think it’s time for some grown-up responsibility by the social media companies writ-large for their platforms, which are clearly having a very detrimental role on young vulnerable populations across West Africa,” Mr Doyle said. “We ... ask social media companies to step up and behave in a responsible way when people are being lured to deaths, to their torture.” It comes as the UN appealed on Monday to countries worldwide to take in 1,300 mainly African refugees stranded in Libya. Many, it said, have suffered mistreatment, while being kept in appalling conditions in detention.  Libya has long struggled to cope with the major influx of migrants from sub-Saharan Africa. The UN estimates there are between 700,000 and one million migrants in the country. Europol’s Migrant Smuggling Centre estimates that 90 per cent of migrants arriving in EU countries have had their journey facilitated by a criminal organisation while the IOM says people smuggling now represents the third-largest business for international criminals. It estimates that people smugglers make a total of roughly $35bn (£27bn) a year worldwide.  The IOM has been in ongoing talks with social media providers about its concerns over their role in the people smuggling market, but Mr Doyle said so far the talks have been “to very little effect”. “What they say is, ‘please tell us the pages and we will shut them down’ ... It is not our job to police Facebook’s pages. Facebook should police its own pages,” Mr Doyle said.  Migrants in a dinghy are rescued by Libyan coast guards off the coast of Garabulli, east of Tripoli Reuters French President Emmanuel Macron observes a minute of silence in front of the plaque commemorating late police officer Ahmed Merabet to mark the third anniversary of the Charlie Hebdo terrorist attack, in Paris Rex  Nicolaos Solis from Greece kisses the wooden cross which was thrown into the waters by Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew I, during the Epiphany ceremony to bless the waters at the Golden Horn in Istanbul AP Women mourn the death of a family member following a landslide in Kinshasa.

WhatsApp, which was developed by Facebook, uses encryption to prohibit third parties from snooping on conversations.  However, the IOM says that feature also makes the messaging app ideal for illicit activities like people smuggling. WhatsApp did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  The IOM spokesman called on social media firms to adopt a more “civic-minded” approach, noting how Google uses pop-up windows to warn users of potential danger or criminality whenever they look at pornography online. Dr Paolo Campana, an expert in criminal networks at Cambridge says the people smuggling market is “very competitive”, so smugglers must go out of their way to attract would-be migrants.  They use social media sites like Facebook to share information and even “post pictures of themselves, of successful crossings, of their boats” as a way to “build trust and credibility”.  But Mr Campana maintains that while social media sites are an effective tool for people smugglers, making deals through word-of-mouth is far more common.  The IOM has helped 13,000 migrants return voluntarily to Nigeria, Guinea and other countries from Libya this year, covering their transport and pocket money fees. Mr Doyle said the organisation is also in the process of repatriating 4,000 migrants to Niger.  We use cookies to enhance your visit to our site and to bring you advertisements that might interest you.

" Quaker group vows to continue to work for 'peace and justice' in spite of ban A Quaker organisation which received the Nobel Peace Prize for rescuing refugees from the Nazis during the Second World War is among 20 activist groups whose members will be barred from entering   over their support for the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions ( ) movement.  follows up on a controversial law enacted by Israel last year which bans any activist who knowingly issues a public call for boycotting the country. Responding to the list, American Friends Service Committee (AFSC) said it would continue to work for peace and justice. The group, together with the Friends Service Council, a British Quaker organisation, won a Nobel Peace Prize in 1947 for assisting Second World War refugees, primarily Jews. We answered the call for divestment from apartheid South Africa and we have done the same with the call for Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions from Palestinians who have faced decades of human rights violations, said Kerri Kennedy, an AFSC official.

It includes the UK-based   (PSC) and War on Want. Asad Rehman, executive director of  , said the blacklist is a desperate attempt to silence a growing movement that is holding Israel to account for its systematic abuse of Palestinian rights, and persistent violations of international law. Mr Rehman said: This measure is typical of Israel’s ongoing repression of the Palestinian people.  The UK government must condemn this latest crackdown on human rights defenders. They must also take immediate steps to hold Israel to account for its continuing violations of Palestinian rights through measures such as the immediate suspension of its trade relations with Israel, including the arms trade. He added: This blacklist is a repressive tactic borrowed from the same playbook used by the apartheid regime in South Africa, when it tried to censor critics. Such attempts to silence human rights defenders through blacklisting and targeted harassment failed then as they will now. Hugh Lanning, chair of the PSC, said in a statement: This latest announcement should be a wakeup call for the UK government and all those who continue to describe Israel as a normal liberal democracy. Liberal democracies do not prevent entry to individuals whose only offence is to draw attention to human rights abuses and to call for non-violent action to address them.  Only states that wish to protect their ability to act unjustly behave in this way.  Boris Johnson must take robust action to protect the rights of UK citizens to protest peacefully and to cross borders without illegitimate restriction. He should make clear that the UK Government will not cooperate with these measures. The US-based Jewish Voice for Peace, which was also blacklisted, said in a Facebook post: Israel's decision to specifically ban JVP is disconcerting but not surprising, given the further erosion of democratic norms and rising anxiety about the power of BDS as a tool to demand freedom. , Gary Spedding, a British cross-party consultant on Israel and the Palestinian Territories, told  the blacklist was merely an excuse to legally justify barring activists and human rights observers from entering the country.  A statement by Israel's Strategic Affairs Ministry said those who have carried out significant, ongoing and consistent harm to Israel through advocating boycotts may be considered to have their entry barred. It said central figures in key boycott organisations risked being prevented entry. The boycott organisations must know that the state of Israel will act against them, Gilad Erdan, the minister for strategic affairs said in a statement. The creation of this list is another step in our struggle against the incitement and lies of the boycott organisations.  The BDS movement has urged businesses, artists and universities to sever ties with Israel and includes thousands of supporters around the world.  Supporters of the movement say the tactics are a nonviolent way to promote the Palestinian cause, while Israel says the campaign goes beyond fighting its occupation of territory Palestinians claim for their state and often masks a more far-reaching aim to delegitimize or destroy the nation of Israel. Last year, Hugh Lanning, chair of the PSC,  , and Professor Kemal Hawwash, a British-Palestinian man, was also  . In a statement, the Israeli embassy in London said: Like all other democracies, Israel will deny entrance to organisations and individuals working to undermine and harm Israel's national security. The organisations named in the list released yesterday have undertaken ongoing, consistent and significant action to promote and advance a boycott of Israel. It said the regulation excludes political criticism of Israel as criteria for an organisation appearing on the list, and added that several other counties had taken steps to counter boycotts against Israel.

" Nadia Murad, speaks out about her life in captivity and the sexual assaults she endured Islamic State militants have lost the last of their strongholds, but for Yazidi survivor  , a new battle is just beginning. Three years after escaping militants in  , Murad is unveiling a harrowing memoir, “The Last Girl,” about her ordeal as a sex slave. Murad's disturbing personal account is part of her effort, represented by human rights lawyer Amal Clooney, to bring Islamic State members to justice for war crimes and genocide against the Yazidi people. “This is not something I chose,” Murad, 24, said in an interview in the lounge of a posh London hotel. “Somebody had to tell these stories. It's not easy.” When the Islamic State swept into northern Iraq in 2014, thousands of Yazidis were killed and thousands more were kidnapped, including women and girls who were taken as sex slaves. UN officials have said the violence committed against the minority sect constituted a genocide, and the UN Security Council has created a task force to collect evidence of atrocities in Iraq. Murad became the first   goodwill ambassador for survivors of human trafficking in 2016, and is pressing her concerns about thousands of Yazidi women and girls who may still be captives and survivors she hopes will be moved from camps and resettled. “The goal of this book is to make sure that everyone knows what happened to the Yazidis and how they suffered,” Murad said. “There are other survivors who dream that one day they will testify about what (ISIS) did to them. Our stories can make a difference.” When the war began, Murad was a student living a quiet life in the village of Kocho in northern Iraq. “Everyone was poor,” she said. “We were satisfied with a life that was simple and humble. We were a peaceful, open people.” The militants arrived in Kocho in August 2014 and ordered everyone to the schoolhouse. The men were then forced to leave, and gunfire soon rang out. Scores of men were killed, including six of Murad's brothers. Murad was put on a bus with other young women, relatives and neighbours, and ISIS fighters began groping the women. One fighter put his hand down her shirt and tried to do “things that happen between lovers when they get married.” ISIS gunmen took away Murad's mother to be killed. They set an elderly woman on fire. Murad and the other young women were taken to the home of a wealthy family in the city of Mosul, where crowds of men grabbed at them. One man extinguished a cigarette on Murad's stomach. Another man chose three women, paying for them in U.S. dollars. The rest were offered up at a chaotic slave market, and Murad was dragged off by the first of her tormentors. “I put the details in the book so I don't have to tell the story every time,” she said forlornly. The   created a self-styled “religious” rationale to justify the sexual abuse of Yazidi women, and girls as young as 9. Some Yazidi women took their own lives. Murad was gang-raped as punishment for trying to escape. “What gave me strength was the hundreds, if not thousands, of girls in captivity,” Murad said. “I told myself, we will be able to survive this.” One day an Islamic State gunman left her alone in a house, and Murad found an unlocked door. She stepped out into the courtyard, climbed the wall and dropped down into an empty street, terrified. “It wasn't about courage,” she said. “You're scared of being put to death, or tortured. All you think about is how to survive.” Murad walked swiftly through the darkening streets of Mosul, her face covered by a long veil. She banged on the door of a house and begged for help. The family inside let her in and eventually smuggled her out of ISIS territory, passing her off as the wife of one of the men. As they went through the last checkpoint, she spotted her photo on a flier showing wanted escapees. Murad made her way to a refugee camp and was accepted as a refugee to Germany in 2015. She now lives with her sister, a war widow, in an apartment in Stuttgart. Murad is still haunted by the failure of people in Mosul to help more Yazidi women. “There were 2 million civilians in Mosul and 2,000 kidnapped girls there,” she said. “There were thousands of families in Mosul that could have helped other girls, but they didn't. Women had to wear veils in Mosul. It would have been easy to smuggle Yazidi women out.” Many of those who did help smuggle Yazidis demanded thousands of dollars - her sister-in-law's family paid $20,000 to get her to safety, Murad said. Last summer, Murad returned to her hometown for a hero's welcome, and tears streamed down her face as she entered her family's destroyed home. “We hoped that our fate would be like the men and we would be killed, but instead Europeans, Saudis, Tunisians and other fighters came and raped us and sold us,” she said, in an improvised speech that was videotaped by news reporters.

" List is excuse to legally justify barring activists and human rights observers, campaigners claim  has published a list of organisations supporting a boycott campaign against the country, whose activists will be banned from entering the Jewish state. Members of 20 groups which back the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions ( ) movement will be denied entry visas and residency rights under a controversial law. Gary Spedding, a British cross-party consultant on Israel and the Palestinian Territories, told   the blacklist was merely an excuse to legally justify barring activists and human rights observers from entering the country.  “Israel’s publishing of a ‘BDS blacklist’ is the latest example of just how fragile the regime actually is and demonstrates a hypersensitivity to legitimate criticisms made of the state’s actions and policies vis-a-vis the  ,” Mr Spedding, who was refused entry to Israel in 2014, said. “This isn’t really about targeting BDS activists. It’s about providing an easier legal pathway to justify refusing entry to a wide range of activists and human rights observers – many who may not even support the BDS campaign but are simply supportive of Palestinian liberty and equality. “Activists who are determined to visit Israel and Palestine, in order to bear witness to the reality on the ground and engage with Israelis and Palestinians, should try to ensure their social media presence is minimal and that they have legitimate tourism plans to elaborate on at entry points into Israel.” The list primarily includes European and American organisations, and features the UK-based   (PSC) and  ,  . Even those holding no official position within the blacklisted organisations will be denied entry, as well as mayors and politicians who promote boycotts. “We have shifted from defence to offence,” said Gilad Erdan, the minister for strategic affairs, according to  .  “The boycott organisations need to know that the state of Israel will act against them and not allow them to enter its territory to harm its citizens. “No country would have allowed critics coming to harm the country to entry it.” Arye Dery, head of the interior ministry which will be responsible for implementing the list, said: “These people are trying to exploit the law and our hospitality to act against Israel and to defame the country. I will act against this by every means.” Israeli forces scuffle with Palestinians at Damascus Gate in Jerusalem's Old City  A Palestinian protester hurls stones as tear gas is fired by Israeli troops Reuters A Palestinian protester runs during clashes with Israeli troops REUTERS Israeli forces scuffle with Palestinians at Damascus Gate in Jerusalem's Old City  Palestinian protesters run during clashes REUTERS Israeli border policemen and a Palestinian protesters clash REUTERS Palestinian protesters react to tear gas REUTERS Israeli border policemen hold on to a Palestinian protester REUTERS Palestinian protesters react to tear gas fired by Israeli troops REUTERS Israeli border policemen and Palestinians scuffle after Friday prayers in Jerusalem's Old City REUTERS A Palestinian protester moves a burning tire during clashes with Israeli troops REUTERS Worshippers chant as they hold Palestinian flags after Friday prayers Reuters A Palestinian protester hurls back a tear gas canister fired by Israeli troops REUTERS A wounded Palestinian protester is evacuated during clashes with Israeli troops REUTERS Israeli border policemen and a Palestinian youth scuffle  REUTERS Israeli border policemen detain a Palestinian man REUTERS A Palestinian protester uses a sling to hurl stones towards Israeli troops  REUTERS Journalists react to tear gas fired by Israeli troops REUTERS Last year, Hugh Lanning, chair of the PSC,  , and Professor Kemal Hawwash, a British-Palestinian man, was also  . In June last year, the PSC and its supporters, including War on Want, brought a legal case against the British Government concerning guidance which restricted local councils from pursuing BDS against Israel through their pension schemes. Campaigners argued people had a right to decide not to profit from human rights abuses, and   the Government had acted unlawfully by seeking to restrict “ethical” boycotts of Israel. Israel’s Strategic Affairs Ministry has been allocated $36m (£27m) for a plan to combat the BDS movement.  The plan calls for a not-for-profit organisation to be established to counter pressure the movement places on artists and companies to boycott Israel,  . In a statement, the Israeli embassy in London said: Like all other democracies, Israel will deny entrance to organisations and individuals working to undermine and harm Israel's national security. The organisations named in the list released yesterday have undertaken ongoing, consistent and significant action to promote and advance a boycott of Israel. It said the regulation excludes political criticism of Israel as criteria for an organisation appearing on the list, and added that several other counties had taken steps to counter boycotts against Israel.

" Eliahu Pietruszka overcome with emotion as meets brother's son Alexandre, 66, in Israel Eliahu Pietruszka shuffled his 102-year-old body through the lobby of his retirement home toward a stranger he had never met and collapsed into him in a teary embrace. Then he kissed both cheeks of his visitor and in a frail, squeaky voice began blurting out greetings in  , a language he hadn't spoken in decades. Only days earlier, the   who fled Poland at the beginning of the   and thought his entire family had perished learned that a younger brother had also survived, and his brother's son, 66-year-old Alexandre, was flying in from a remote part of Russia to see him. The emotional meeting was made possible by Israel's Yad Vashem Holocaust memorial's comprehensive online database of Holocaust victims. “It makes me so happy that at least one remnant remains from my brother, and that is his son,” said Pietruszka, tears welling in his eyes. “After so many years I have been granted the privilege to meet him.” ​Pietruszka was 24 when he fled Warsaw in 1939 as the Second World War erupted, heading to the   and leaving behind his parents and twin brothers Volf and Zelig, who were nine years younger. His parents and Zelig were deported from the Warsaw Ghetto and killed in a Nazi death camp, but Volf also managed to escape. The brothers briefly corresponded before Volf was sent by the Russians to a Siberian work camp, where Pietruszka assumed he had died. “In my heart, I thought he was no longer alive,” Pietruszka said. He married in Russia and, thinking he had no family left, migrated to Israel in 1949 to start a new one. Then two weeks ago, his grandson, Shakhar Smorodinsky, received an email from a cousin in Canada who was working on her family tree. She said she had uncovered a Yad Vashem page of testimony filled out in 2005 by Volf Pietruszka for his older brother Eliahu, who he thought had died. Volf, it turned out, had survived and settled in Magnitogorsk, an industrial city in the Ural Mountains. Smorodinsky tracked down an address and reached out to discover that Volf, who had spent his life as a construction worker, had died in 2011 but that Alexandre, his only child, still lived there. After Smorodinsky arranged a brief Skype chat, Alexandre decided to come see the uncle he never knew he had. Image: Israeli Holocaust survivor Eliahu Pietruszka, center, looks at a picture with Alexandre Pietruszka and family in the central Israeli city of Kfar Saba on Nov. 16, 2017. Smorodinsky, a 47-year-old professor from Ben-Gurion University in southern Israel, invited The Associated Press to record Thursday evening's reunion at his grandfather's retirement home in central Israel. Upon meeting, the two men clutched each other tightly and chatted in Russian as they examined each other's similar facial features. “You are a copy of your father,” said a shaking Pietruszka, who has a hearing aid and gets around in a rolling walker. “I haven't slept in two nights waiting for you.” Throughout the meeting, Alexandre swallowed hard to hold back years, repeatedly shaking his head in disbelief. “It's a miracle. I never thought this would happen,” Alexandre, himself a retired construction worker, kept saying. It did, thanks to the Yad Vasham database of pages of testimony, whose goal is to gather and commemorate the names of all of the estimated 6 million Jewish victims of the Nazi genocide. The Names Recovery Project has been Yad Vashem's flagship mission in recent years. The memorials very name — Yad Vashem is Hebrew for “a memorial and a name” — alludes to its central mission of commemorating the dead as individuals, rather than mere numbers like the Nazis did. It hasn't been an easy task. The project began in 1954, but over the following half century, fewer than 3 million names were collected, mostly because the project was not widely known and many survivors refrained from reopening wounds, or clung to hopes that their relatives might still be alive. The names collected are commemorated in the museum's Hall of Names, a cone-shaped room whose walls are lined with bookshelves containing folders upon folders of testimonies. Still, until 2004, more than half of the allotted folders remained empty. That year, the database went online and provided immediate easy access to information in English, Hebrew, Russian, Spanish and German. Thanks to a high-profile campaign, and the efforts of Yad Vashem officials who have gone door-to-door to interview elderly survivors, the number has surged to 4.7 million names. Another rewarding byproduct has been that of tech-savvy grandchildren using it to research their families, leading to emotional reunions between various degrees of relatives from around the world. The rate of reunions has trickled significantly in recent years as elderly survivors have passed away, making each one increasingly significant, said Alexander Avram, the director of the database. “It is not too late to fill out pages of testimony. We need to document each and every victim of the Holocaust,” he said. “But such a reunion is a very special moment because we are not going to see a lot more of them in the future.” Debbie Berman, a Yad Vashem official at the reunion, said it was incredibly moving to be there for “the end of an era.” 80,000 shoes line a display case in Auschwitz I.

" ‘This is because the assumption is that, in primary education, the groundwork for the Iranian culture of the students is laid,’ says head of the state-run High Education Council  has banned English from being taught in primary schools after the country’s Supreme Leader said learning the language in the early years paved the way for a Western “cultural invasion”. A senior education official announced the language had been banned because the Iranian culture of students is established during primary level education.  In Iran, where Persian is the country’s official national language, primary school starts at the age of six and lasts for six years. While the teaching of English generally starts in middle school in Iran – which students attend around the ages of 12 to 14 – some primary schools below that age also have English classes.  “Teaching English in government and non-government primary schools in the official curriculum is against laws and regulations,” Mehdi Navid-Adham, head of the state run High Education Council, said on state television late on Saturday. He continued: “This is because the assumption is that, in primary education, the groundwork for the Iranian culture of the students is laid”. He said non-curriculum English classes may also be blocked under the new rules. Iran’s Shia-Islamist leaders have often issued pleas about the risks posed by a “cultural invasion”.  In 2016 Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who holds the final say in all state matters, expressed fury about the “teaching of the English language spreading to nursery schools”. According to the text of that particular speech to teachers posted on a website run by his office, Khamenei said: “That does not mean opposition to learning a foreign language, but [this is the] promotion of a foreign culture in the country and among children, young adults and youths.” Migrants in a dinghy are rescued by Libyan coast guards off the coast of Garabulli, east of Tripoli Reuters French President Emmanuel Macron observes a minute of silence in front of the plaque commemorating late police officer Ahmed Merabet to mark the third anniversary of the Charlie Hebdo terrorist attack, in Paris Rex  Nicolaos Solis from Greece kisses the wooden cross which was thrown into the waters by Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew I, during the Epiphany ceremony to bless the waters at the Golden Horn in Istanbul AP Women mourn the death of a family member following a landslide in Kinshasa.

" Palestinian agriculture was once a pillar of the local economy, but, for farmers in the West Bank, which is under full Israeli control, protecting their livelihoods has become a daily struggle  Jalud, West Bank – Palestinian farmer Fawzi Ibrahim is proud of his heirloom corn, whose kernels ripen in iridescent shades of red, blue and gold like jewels. But what makes it priceless are the obstacles he faces to grow his crops. Small farmers struggle worldwide. But international experts say Palestinian farmers face disabling odds in the 60 per cent of the West Bank that is under full Israeli control and is home to some 400,000 Jewish settlers. As settler agricultural start-ups get prioritised access to water, export markets and development rights, the Israeli occupation is roiling the centuries-old pastoral life of Palestinian farmers, experts say, adding fuel to a conflict in which land is a trigger. For years, Israeli settlers have chased Ibrahim’s tractor, threatened him, yelled at his Israeli soldier escorts, tried to burn his fields and warned that letting him farm would risk bloodshed, according to the Israeli group Rabbis for Human Rights. Ibrahim must coordinate with the Israeli army because his land is in a security zone abutting Israeli outposts, the group said. But he and his lawyer waited eight weeks for permission to plant 50 acres of winter wheat in just two days, under the guard of two jeeploads of Israeli soldiers. A human rights worker and Israeli settlers looked on. Ibrahim said he fears he will suffer thousands of dollars in farming losses again this year. “They’re making us poor,” he said. A recent UN report said the Israeli occupation has set off a “continuous process of de-agriculturisation” in the Israeli-controlled West Bank, depriving the Palestinian economy of potential agriculture revenue of $700m, by World Bank estimates, as Israeli settlers bar Palestinians from crops, grazing lands and springs. The World Food Program is providing food assistance to 75,000 Palestinians in Area C, according to local spokesman Raphael du Boispean. A December report by the Israeli human rights group B'Tselem said Israeli settlements have overtaken a half-million acres of former Palestinian lands in Israel-controlled Area C, which was placed under full Israeli control in 1990s accords. B’Tselem said an estimated 200,000 and 300,000 Palestinians live in Area C. “What the Israeli settlers are doing in those areas is a disaster,” said Avshalom Vilan, executive director of Israel’s powerful Farmers Federation, a mainstream private farmers group. “They’re stealing from the lives of their Palestinian neighbours, and making their lives impossible. “It’s in Israel’s interest for Palestinian farmers to work their land peacefully,” Vilan said. “We will all pay for this.” Yishai Fleisher, the international spokesman of the Jewish settlement in Hebron, said that “life will be much easier for Palestinian farmers under a one-state solution, in which minorities are incorporated into the state of Israel.” “Jews live in the settlements because they are the heartlands of the Bible and Jewish history,” Fleisher said. “Many of us are also in the settlements to thwart the two-state solution, because we think it's wrong, unjust and dangerous.” Spokesmen for the Israeli settlers’ Yesha Council, the Agriculture Ministry and the office of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu declined to comment. Israel’s Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories Unit, or COGAT, said 5 per cent of Palestinian fields “adjacent to Israeli villages” in the West Bank require Israeli permission and escorts “to ensure that their work goes undisturbed ... while implementing their right to cultivate their land.” COGAT said it provided 600 such escorts in 2016 for the Palestinian olive harvest, a target of Israeli settler attacks. The Rand Corp. said settler attacks quadrupled from 2006 to 2014 and are “an important trigger of Palestinian retribution”. A 2013 World Bank report said the agriculture contribution to the Palestinian economy declined by more than half in Area C in the past two decades, with Palestinians losing access to water and land, and less than 1 per cent of land designated for Palestinian construction. Meanwhile, Israeli settlement agriculture rose 35 per cent, by World Bank estimates, with growing exports to Europe and Russia. COGAT said Israelis provide training to Palestinian farmers and operators of a German-financed wastewater treatment plant, and oversaw the shipping of 113,000 tonnes of Palestinian produce outside the West Bank in 2016 – a tiny fraction, said Palestinian Authority official Marwan Durzi, of the export potential of 2.6 million tonnes of Palestinian agriculture. Durzi said settler appropriation of springs forces Palestinian villagers to drastically reduce village herds, while Israeli authorities deny Palestinians permits for wells and cisterns and demolish non-permitted irrigation. Since most Palestinian families in Area C live partly on farming, “it’s crippling,” Durzi said. Ibrahim was a scion of a prosperous family in the 1980s, when Israelis took 2,000 acres of family farmland and olive groves in the West Bank, ending his agronomy studies at Texas A&M University. Israeli rights groups helped him recover 100 acres. Ibrahim watches subsidised Israeli agriculture start-ups flourish on land he claims at Shvut Rachel, a Jewish outpost founded in the name of Rachela Druck, a settler killed in a 1991 Palestinian attack on a bus. Shvut Rachel’s most famous onetime resident, Jack Teitel, was convicted in 2013 for killing two Palestinians. Alleged Hamas militants shot Israeli student Malachy Rosenfeld on the highway as he traveled through the area in 2015 – just a few miles from Ibrahim's land. In January, Israeli authorities indicted four Israeli settlers who lived on a hilltop near Ibrahim's fields in Geulat Zion – once home to an Israeli accused of the 2015 firebomb killing of a Palestinian mother, father and baby in nearby Duma – after Israeli undercover police allegedly caught them going after Palestinian farmers with stones and truncheons. Settlers “do what their government wants them to do,” Ibrahim said. “They want them to take the land.” Ibrahim said his family once farmed alfalfa and barley on land seized for vineyards by the Esh Kodesh outpost, which has Israeli-supplied water. But Aaron Katsof, an Esh Kodesh vintner, insisted that “there was nothing here”. An Israeli court ordered a settler to clear his vineyards off a parcel of Ibrahim’s land by December 2015, and though the settler finally moved this year, he was convicted of kidnapping and beating a Palestinian shepherd, and Ibrahim says he's still afraid to reclaim the land. Ibrahim remembers the days when younger Palestinians waited for the harvest to marry, and patriarchs lived well from the land. To Ibrahim’s generation, he said, “land is life”.

" Several Latin American and African nations abstain from vote after America threatened to cut aid programmes In a humiliating blow for   on the world stage, the United Nations General Assembly has voted by 128 to nine to declare his   to recognise   as Israel’s capital “null and void”.  Just days after the US used its veto power at the UN Security Council to block a similar measure, the General Assembly resoundingly condemned the America’s unilateral action, which most observers said would hamper efforts to secure peace in the Middle East.  While the vote has little practical impact – it is not legally binding – it is a considerable embarrassment for the US as it reflects global opinion. As the US licked its wounds, Palestinian Authority leader Mahmoud Abbas’s spokesman Nabil Abu Rdainah seized on what he said was a “victory for Palestine”.  “We will continue our efforts in the United Nations and at all international forums to put an end to this occupation, and to establish our Palestinian state with East Jerusalem as its capital,” Mr Rdainah said.  Thirty-five countries, many in Africa and Latin America, abstained from the vote. Experts had predicted at least 150 votes in support of the motion. There was speculation that the high number of abstentions was a result of the Trump administration’s threat to “take names” of countries and cut off humanitarian aid funding.  Rwanda, Uganda, South Sudan, Malawi, and several Caribbean and Pacific island nations all abstained. Canada, Poland, Australia, and Mexico also joined them in sitting out the vote, in perhaps a nod to other political pressures from the US. Britain voted for the motion, as did India and Russia.  Ahead of the vote, the US’s ambassador to the UN, Nikki Haley, had warned that the US would would be “taking names” of any countries who supported a resolution criticising Washington’s actions. The Associated Press said Ms Haley had written to most of the 193 UN members states warning of possible retaliation. She said the President was taking the matter personally. Speaking to members of his cabinet on Wednesday, Mr Trump said he liked what Ms Haley had spelled out. “For all these nations, they take our money and then vote against us. They take hundreds of millions of dollars, even billions of dollars and then they vote against us,” Mr Trump said.  “We’re watching those votes. Let them vote against us. We’ll save a lot. We don’t care.” In 2016, the US contributed approximately $13bn (£9.7bn)​ in economic and military assistance to countries in Sub-Saharan Africa, and $1.6bn to states in East Asia and Oceania, according to the US Agency for International Development.  Ukraine was among the 21 nations that were not present for the vote.  Migrants in a dinghy are rescued by Libyan coast guards off the coast of Garabulli, east of Tripoli Reuters French President Emmanuel Macron observes a minute of silence in front of the plaque commemorating late police officer Ahmed Merabet to mark the third anniversary of the Charlie Hebdo terrorist attack, in Paris Rex  Nicolaos Solis from Greece kisses the wooden cross which was thrown into the waters by Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew I, during the Epiphany ceremony to bless the waters at the Golden Horn in Istanbul AP Women mourn the death of a family member following a landslide in Kinshasa.

" Second time in 2018 Trump has threatened to withhold aid on Twitter America may withhold aid money to the   if they walk away from peace negotiations,   threatened. In a pair of tweets, Mr Trump wrote that “we pay the Palestinians HUNDRED OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS a year and get no appreciation or respect”. “We have taken Jerusalem, the toughest part of the negotiation, off the table, but Israel, for that, would have had to pay more,” Mr Trump said in reference to his decision to recognise Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. “But with the Palestinians no longer willing to talk peace, why should we make any of these massive future payments to them”. ...peace treaty with Israel. We have taken Jerusalem, the toughest part of the negotiation, off the table, but Israel, for that, would have had to pay more. But with the Palestinians no longer willing to talk peace, why should we make any of these massive future payments to them? The provocative messages are likely to inject further uncertainty into America’s relationship with Palestinian leadership, already strained by Mr Trump’s move to recognise Jerusalem as Israel’s capital. Palestinian officials and other critics warned Mr Trump’s move squandered American credibility as a neutral mediator, undercutting the prospect of a peace settlement. America’s ambassador to the United Nations, Nikki Haley, had foreshadowed the President’s tweets, saying the Trump administration was considering clamping down on funding for the the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees.  “He doesn’t want to give any additional funding until the Palestinians agree to come back to the negotiation table, and what we saw with the resolution was not helpful to the situation,” Ms Haley said. “We’re trying to move for a peace process, but if that doesn’t happen, the president is not going to continue to fund that situation.” Migrants in a dinghy are rescued by Libyan coast guards off the coast of Garabulli, east of Tripoli Reuters French President Emmanuel Macron observes a minute of silence in front of the plaque commemorating late police officer Ahmed Merabet to mark the third anniversary of the Charlie Hebdo terrorist attack, in Paris Rex  Nicolaos Solis from Greece kisses the wooden cross which was thrown into the waters by Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew I, during the Epiphany ceremony to bless the waters at the Golden Horn in Istanbul AP Women mourn the death of a family member following a landslide in Kinshasa.

While that resolution did not carry legal force, it prompted a sharp rebuke from Ms Haley, who warned that America “will remember this day” when “we are called upon once again to make the world’s largest contribution to the United Nations”. “When a nation is singled out for attack in this organisation,” Ms Haley warned the UN, “that nation is disrespected. What’s more, that nation is asked to pay for the privilege of being disrespected.” The President’s latest tweets, like Ms Haley’s response to the UN resolution, articulated a recurring theme in Mr Trump’s world view: the idea that America doles out money to international entities and other nations without receiving enough in return. Earlier this week, the President stirred geopolitical turmoil by lashing out at Pakistan on similar grounds, proclaiming on Twitter that America “has foolishly given Pakistan more than 33 billion dollars in aid over the last 15 years, and they have given us nothing but lies & deceit, thinking of our leaders as fools.” We use cookies to enhance your visit to our site and to bring you advertisements that might interest you.

" Don’t let your wardrobe be your downfall Happy Veganuary – a whole month dedicated to supporting people who have decided to go vegan.  But while you might have removed animals from your diet, it’s important to consider what this means for your wardrobe too. From vegans and veggies to animal lovers, a growing number of consumers are becoming more and more conscious about where their products come from. Don’t believe us? Well, the rapidly evolving natural and organic personal care market was estimated to be worth around $11bn (£8bn) internationally in 2016 – a figure that’s expected to double by 2024, according to Ernst & Young. Luckily, the industry is responding and finding that vegan-friendly items is getting easier with time as new brands embrace animal-free design.  When it comes to fashion, it’s important as a consumer to consider what makes something vegan.  In this case, it means pieces that are made with absolutely no animal products including leather, fur, silk, wool, feathers and bone. And you’ll be pleased to hear there are a surprising amount of brands that fly in the face of the idea that vegan garb parallels with a serious lack of style.  While brands lisuch as Dr Martens offer a vegan range, others like Matt & Nat, Bourgeois Boheme, Wilby, Brave Gentleman and Beyond Skin are dedicated to delivering 100 per cent vegan products including bags, wallets and shoes. Plus, we can’t go without mentioning the undisputed queen of the vegan handbag, Stella McCartney.  One of the most famous vegans, McCartney is committed to producing animal-friendly pieces and refuses to use any leather or fur in her designs. From the brand’s super-stylish faux suede bags, to key chains and vegan silk, the designer is a pioneer of ethical fashion and proves that animal-free products don’t have to compromise on style.  While the fashion industry has quite a way to go before ever being entirely ethical, the good news is that brands are beginning to bow to the pressure of animal rights groups such as Peta. Earlier this year, Gucci committed to being fur-free, starting with its spring summer 2018 collection, while just this month Michael Kors announced that it will longer use animal fur in its products – a policy that will also apply to Jimmy Choo.  We use cookies to enhance your visit to our site and to bring you advertisements that might interest you.

" It is important to us that we get things right.  Our commitment to high standards is embodied in our company Code of Conduct, which is set out in full below.  This Code applies to all members of our editorial staff, as well as freelancers who work for us, and our business partners. In the event that we get something wrong, we would like to know about it.  As such, for any feedback or complaints about editorial material – either in print or online – or about the conduct of our journalists in the course of their work please contact our complaints and customer service team using the link below.  If you have any queries about the complaints process please email the office of the managing editor by email (managingeditor@standard.co.uk). Before making your complaint it may help to read the answers to some frequently asked questions, as they might deal with the matter you want to raise –  .  To lodge a complaint please complete the form  . To send a letter for publication please email  . Information about advertising can be found here:  .   You can also contact us by telephone on 020 3367 7000 or in writing: The Independent, Northcliffe House, 2 Derry Street, Kensington, London W8 5TT. INTRODUCTION AND SCOPE The reputation of our brands is based on the editorial independence, integrity and high journalistic standards of our output. The rules set out here are intended to apply to all our platforms (print, digital and broadcast), unless it is stated otherwise.  You must follow these rules even when they set a ‘higher bar’ than other external regulations unless you have specific approval to the contrary from a senior executive. The Editorial provisions of the Code are applicable to all employees, workers, and contributors to the Group's publications, whether contracted or freelance or otherwise commissioned.  While individuals take personal responsibility for their own compliance, managers should also ensure this Code is understood and complied with by employees, workers and contributors in their own areas.  If managers believe that they or those working for them have insufficient knowledge about the legal and regulatory environment within which they work, they must contact the managing editor’s office. In addition to this Code, you must adhere to the general law and any other external regulations as required by the Group - notably the Broadcasting Code overseen by Ofcom, in respect of material broadcast by London Live; and the Editors’ Code of Practice in respect of material published by the Evening Standard or Independent (whether in print or online, including any related websites such as indy100, and including official social media channels (Twitter, Facebook etc)). Many staff will work primarily for one company within the Group.  Managers should be aware, therefore, that individuals may require advice and guidance on regulatory questions if they are contributing to a platform that is outside their usual sphere of operations. If you have any queries about relevant regulations or legal matters, please contact the managing editor’s office or head of legal as appropriate. Breaking rules can sometimes be justified where there is a legitimate 'public interest' in publishing a story.  This can include such things as detecting or exposing crime or impropriety, protecting the security of the general public and preventing people and communities from being misled by the behaviour of another individual or organisation.  The public interest is not, of course, the same thing as ‘being interesting to the public’.  Context is vital to making judgements about what might be in the public interest. With regard to the law, it is no defence to certain criminal offences (e.g. phone-hacking) that any resulting story would be in the public interest.  In other areas of the law (for instance the Data Protection Act), the public interest might be a factor but you should seek legal advice if you believe that your journalistic activity may result in a breach of any legislation. If you believe that a story breaches this Code or industry best practice but has a public interest justification you should discuss the terms of that justification as precisely as possible with your line manager and, if necessary, with other senior editorial executives.  If circumstances permit, it may be useful to take a brief note of such discussions, although the Group recognises that it will often not be feasible because of deadline and other time pressures.  If in doubt, speak in the first instance to your line manager.  If you are planning an undercover investigation (i.e. any investigation where you are deliberately hiding the fact that you are a journalist) you should always seek prior approval from the managing editor’s office, bearing in mind the information in this Code below.   PREPARING FOR PUBLICATION You must fully cooperate with the editors in the area you are working in or for, and undertake whatever pre-publication checks and research are requested by those editors or by the companies’ legal advisers or other relevant executives. Legal claims can be hugely expensive to the Group as well as damaging to its reputation.  To be in the best position to defend a claim or complaint it is important that the people involved in preparation and publication of the story ensure that: Always ask for advice about any specific issues you are not sure about.  Also, be mindful of the need to remain up to date with all information provided on legal and compliance subjects, and make sure you familiarise yourself with legal bulletins and notices sent out by your department heads, by the companies’ head of legal, the managing editor’s office or by other senior executives. It is your duty to raise, in a full and frank manner and making full disclosure, any issues that could have a bearing on whether publication of any material you are involved in complies with all legal and regulatory requirements as well as any issues to do with staff conduct. If in doubt about regulatory matters please contact your line manager or the managing editor’s office. In the course of your work you will speak to a great many people.  Except in exceptional circumstances (see below), you should be up front about the fact you are a journalist and you must always identify who you are and who you work for when asked, unless there are public interest reasons for not doing so. You must not intimidate or harass individuals nor engage in persistent physical pursuit.  If you are asked to stop questioning, contacting, filming or photographing someone you must do so.  Public interest exemptions can apply in this area but they are relatively rare.  In the first instance you should consult your line manager if there is any complaint about your conduct (more information about what to do if someone makes a complaint is set out below). The same rules apply when contacting somebody via email, Facebook or Twitter that apply in relation to face-to-face meetings and phone conversations: if someone says they don’t want to be contacted further, you should stop – whatever the platform you are communicating on. In cases involving grief, you must conduct your enquiries with particular sympathy and discretion.  If you plan to approach somebody who is in hospital (or any medical institution, including a care home) you are likely to require consent from the hospital’s authorities before doing so.  You must not approach children at school without the consent of parents  the school authorities. If an investigative story or any allegation of wrongdoing depends on the word of a single source you should try and get it corroborated by at least one other, unconnected and trustworthy source.  In some circumstances you will need to formalise the evidence that you have obtained from a key source (eg by preparing a witness statement).  You may in such cases need to speak to the Group’s head of legal. If a source needs to remain confidential you should ensure that they cannot be identified – directly or indirectly - from your notes, or any data on your mobile phone or other device. You should be cautious how you use the internet or social media to obtain material for a story, both in terms of trustworthiness of the information or identification, and also the rights in the material (eg copyright). From the point of view of rights ownership, you should bear in mind that what you see online, including on social media, is not free for use just because it is free to view.  So, not only must you consider questions of accuracy and privacy, you should also assess whether material can lawfully be reproduced or even drawn on without the consent of the rights holder and whether re-use of that material may carry a fee. In any event, you must always attribute content as fully as possible so that readers know its origins. Consider too whether material – especially from social media or from historic sources – might constitute a contempt of court in relation to current, ongoing legal proceedings. There is no blanket prohibition on journalists talking to children or on using what they say for publication.  However, you must not – unless there is an   public interest – speak to a child under 16 on any subject that touches on his/her, or another child’s, welfare (that is, probably any personal issue) without the consent of whoever has legal custody of the child.  It is usually   adequate to rely on consent from a teacher, a non-custodial parent or other family member, e.g. grandparent. If in doubt, ask a child how old they are and get confirmation if you are still unsure.  The onus is on you to establish an accurate age. If you have any uncertainty about the public interest requirements or any other matter, do talk to your department head and then, as appropriate, the managing editor’s office, the Group’s head of legal or another senior executive. It is not only good, responsible journalism but also a keystone of how we might defend a libel complaint, that any potentially critical or damaging reference is put to the subject before publication. This ensures that the subject is given the opportunity to point out any errors in a story as well as to comment on it so that their response can be included in the article in the interests of fairness.  The more serious the allegation, the more important it is to provide the subject with a proper opportunity to respond.  You should consider whether it would be appropriate to email a request in which you set out each allegation and give the subject an adequate amount of time to respond (sometimes it may be useful to send a repeat request).  Always try to be realistic in your requests: bearing in mind the possibility that different time-zones and weekend/evening availability may have an impact on a subject’s ability to respond. And make sure you are as specific as possible in the questions you ask. Contributors, especially to broadcast material, should be informed of the wider context within which their comments will be placed and – where applicable – be told about who else may be contributing to the same programme or article. You should where possible make detailed notes or keep other contemporaneous records of pre-publication conversations or exchanges, and these should be retained, bearing in mind that you may have to produce them as evidence in court. It is acceptable to audio-record key telephone conversations with people to whom you have identified yourself as a journalist provided you only use the recording as a background aid in place of or in addition to handwritten notes.  If you intend to publish the recording you must make that clear at the outset and obtain consent (note: subterfuge, and its public interest justifications, is dealt with below). If you have obtained material from the internet it is important that you retain copies of relevant pages, tweets, pictures or posts.  Since information can easily be taken offline, you should take screen-grabs of any material that could be contentious or disputed. When commissioning material from a freelance individual or entity, for example an outside investigative company, you should take steps to consider whether their track-record suggests they are professional, reliable and trustworthy. If you are in any doubt, refer the issue to your department head.  Any freelance you intend to use should be directed to this Code of Conduct and to the Terms for Freelance Contributions on the Group’s websites with which they are required to comply. We do not pay individuals or agencies for information about third parties that could breach their rights.  However, there are exceptional circumstances when it could theoretically be acceptable: where the story would be in the public interest.  If you are considering paying a source for such information you must fill in an Approval Form (see Appendix A), and submit it for approval to your line manager and the managing editor’s office (and to the Chief Operating Officer for London Live). Parents should not be paid for information involving their child’s welfare, unless payment can be shown genuinely to be in the child’s interest. In line with industry best practice there can be no payments or promises of payment to witnesses in criminal trials; there can be no payments to those who might reasonably be expected to be witnesses in future trials unless there is a public interest; and there can be no payments to convicted criminals or their associates for any material relating to their crime, unless there are exceptional circumstances (in which case you must discuss the case with your line manager and the managing editor’s office). Crucially, you must be aware that any payment to a police officer or public official will breach the law without exemption. No one should break the criminal law in their work for the Group. Anyone engaging in any form of deception for journalistic purposes (and this includes where they do not make it clear they are a journalist when making enquiries) should seek approval in advance by completing an Approval Form (see Appendix B).  It is important that this happens at an early stage in order that a proper record of the decision-making process is made which can be produced subsequently if necessary. The form should be completed after discussion with your department head and the managing editor’s office, if possible before you embark on any sort of undercover investigation, no matter how apparently insubstantial.  Failure to get advance approval could lead to non-compliance with the company’s Code or a tainting of crucial legal evidence. If you genuinely did not have an opportunity to seek approval in advance, or an external journalist or entity has come to us with evidence obtained through subterfuge, you must refer it urgently to your department head and the managing editor’s office so that the situation can be properly assessed. You should be transparent about any outside political, philosophical, religious or financial interests that might conflict with your journalistic independence or integrity, or could be perceived to do so. You should declare an interest before publication to your department head when you are involved with something with which you have a significant connection.  The desk head should then decide whether a declaration should appear in any relevant article or broadcast, referring the matter to the managing editor’s office as appropriate.  For more information see the Conflicts of Interest Policy. Even where the law may permit it, our journalists - whatever their status: employed, contracted, freelance or any other - should never use for their own profit financial information they receive in the course of their work before such information is published, nor should they pass such information to others.  You must inform your department head of any significant interest in any shares or securities that you know you or your close family/ associates hold before writing or broadcasting about such shares or securities.  You must not buy or sell, directly or through nominees or agents, shares or securities about which you have written recently or intend to write or which you have discussed in broadcast material. If anyone writing about financial information is concerned about a potential conflict of interest, they must raise their concerns immediately with their department head.  There are special rules for those working on business and city desks whereby journalists must ensure that an accurate and updated record is kept by their desk head or the managing editor’s office of all relevant investments and interests. If you are presented with a confidentiality agreement – a book or speech embargo for example – you must pass it to your desk head and, where appropriate, discuss the matter with the managing editor’s office or the head of legal.  Signature of such an agreement might bind not only your desk, but you  and the company (or Group).  You should not sign it or take on such a commitment without consulting whether that is in the Group's interests. If you agree with a content provider that our use of a story, picture or video material should be restricted, either in terms of our initial publication or our syndication or exploitation of it, then you should inform the syndication department who will, in liaison with the head of legal and/or managing editor’s office, issue the appropriate restricted rights warning.   PUBLICATION We do not set out to offend the general reader or viewer and you should always consider how people will respond to our material. That is not to say that we should necessarily shy away from publication simply for fear that it might provoke a negative reaction in some quarters.   Insofar as broadcast material is concerned, the Ofcom Code makes clear that: “generally accepted standards must be applied to the contents of TV…services so as to provide protection for  from…harmful or offensive material.”  It goes on:  “Broadcasters must ensure that material which may cause offence is justified by  .” With regard to material broadcast on London Live you should, therefore, always consider factors including: the likely audience at the time the material appears; the possibility of needing to ‘sign-post’ upcoming material; and more generally whether the audience will understand the context of the material. It is our primary endeavour to publish information that is accurate and will not mislead readers.  You must take care not to distort information either by disingenuous phrasing or by omission. If you think that material has been published or broadcast that is wrong, you should notify your line manager and the managing editor’s office.  It may be necessary to take corrective action but you should not generally proceed without discussion. TV news and other programmes that might be considered to fall into the ‘current affairs’ bracket are subject to rules governing impartiality.  The Ofcom Code sets out those rules in full. There are no specific rules regarding the way newspapers cover elections insofar as impartiality is concerned.  Ofcom, meanwhile, requires that “due weight must be given to the coverage of major parties during the election period” and that broadcasters “consider giving appropriate coverage to other parties, candidates”.  When preparing material for broadcast in election periods you should make sure you are fully versed in the relevant rules. Exit polls or partial results must not be published on the day of an election before polls have closed.  Seek advice if you are not sure.  All substantial material and quotes should be attributed correctly (ie. by author and/or by title of the publication), whatever the source of such material, including another media outlet, agency, writer or journalist.  Sources should be identified unless their security or a prior agreement of confidentiality dictates otherwise.  The principle is to be transparent.  Images should, similarly, be appropriately captioned.  If you have sourced comments from social media or other websites you should take care to ensure that you do not present the material as if it has been provided as part of an interview. And remember that there may be a cost attached to re-using material whether you attribute it properly or not. If quoting someone directly, you should generally use their exact words.  If you do not want to use the way they have expressed something then, if it is editorially justified, you should not quote directly but paraphrase their words in indirect speech, taking care not to change the actual meaning. You should exercise caution if you want to quote someone anonymously.  Ask yourself what their motivation is if they are not prepared to go on the record, and whether an improper purpose could taint their reliability as a source (and thus make defending our published or broadcast material more difficult). In order to ensure the integrity and independence of our editorial content we should not offer copy or picture approval to any subject.  If this is the only way to secure an interview, approval must be sought in advance from your desk head or relevant senior executives. Evidence suggests that media reporting of suicide can influence others who are suicidal or mentally fragile to take their own lives.  When reporting suicide you should avoid excessive detail about the method used: information that amounts to a step-by-step guide will be too much.  Care should also be taken not to glamorise suicide or its victims; and not perpetually to repeat details of past suicides at a particular place. There are no specific rules regarding the presentation of information about drugs, tobacco or alcohol insofar as newspapers’ editorial content is concerned.  However, the Ofcom Code makes clear that care should be taken not to glamorise on television the taking of such substances unless there is editorial justification (primarily in order to protect children). When reporting on stories involving sexual assault, the utmost care should be taken to avoid identifying the victim. Legally, victims (and alleged victims) have a right to anonymity. However, this is not just a question of omitting an individual’s name; any identifying details should be avoided. Remember, a seemingly innocuous detail may be very revealing to members of a local community. You should also be aware of the possibility of jigsaw identification, where a combination of small details effectively identifies the victim. Remember, identifying a victim of a sex crime is a itself a criminal offence. On occasion, an individual may waive their right to anonymity, or the court may permit the identification of the victim. In such circumstances, you should obtain clear evidence that consent has been granted before proceeding with publication in order to remove any possibility of confusion. Waivers of anonymity by a victim must be in writing. If in doubt, seek advice from the managing editor’s office or the head of legal.   Under no circumstances should a child victim of sexual assault or witness in a sex case be identified. Again, be wary of what details you include in the report; if the case involves incest, you can either identify the defendant but ensure that there is no suggestion of their relation to the victim, or report the incestuous nature of the crime, but ensure the defendant is not identified. You should be cognisant of how other media have reported the case to guard against accidental jigsaw identification. Care should be taken not to discriminate against people on the basis of, for instance, their sexual orientation, religion or race (or by virtue of an illness or disability). This means avoiding pejorative references to those aspects of their lives; but it also means not referring to them at all unless relevant to story. We should avoid intrusions into people's privacy: that is, reporting details about their personal lives unless there is a clear public interest in doing so.  For example, you should take care if thinking about reporting: addresses (or identifying private homes directly or indirectly); medical information; and information obtained in personal communications including email or limited access social media.  The English law can be used to protect an individual’s privacy rights no matter where in the world that person is based. In cases involving bereavement or shock, sensitivity and discretion are especially important, not only because of the personal impact on individuals but also because, in line with industry-wide guidelines, we do not permit any public interest justification for intruding into a person’s grief.   We should not report gratuitous information about a person’s death or make light of genuine tragedies.  Images of dead bodies (especially if the individual is identifiable) should be avoided except in exceptional circumstances, for instance in connection to reporting atrocities of war. The Data Protection Act has the potential to impact journalists in two ways: 1) you might try to obtain information from people or organisations that will cite the Act as a reason for refusing to divulge information; and/or 2) as a person who is processing data, you have to comply with the Act when writing about personal information.  More information about this is contained in the Data Protection Policy, and you should seek advice from your department head or the Group’s head of legal if you have any queries. Individuals must not be photographed or filmed in places where they have a ‘reasonable expectation of privacy’ – nor should we knowingly publish material resulting from such photography/filming, whether created by us or by another person.  This does not only refer to private property owned by the individual in question.  Churches, cafes, places of work and hotels have all been regarded as places where there can be a reasonable expectation of privacy, and even public beaches.  However, each case must be judged on its merits and you should discuss with relevant senior executives, the managing editor’s office or the Group’s legal advisers if in doubt. If material is well-established in the public domain, that may over-ride the usual privacy protections.  However, you must not work on the premise that, because you can access a picture publicly, it is therefore automatically safe for use. Under-16s must not be photographed or filmed on subjects about their welfare – or the welfare of other children – without the consent of their custodial parent/guardian.  It is imperative that there is no room for debate about whether consent has been granted and you should always seek clarity before photographing/filming, if there is any doubt.  This restriction, as well as the restriction on interviewing children referred to above, carries over into publication.  In essence, even if the information or pictures have not come directly from the child him or herself (eg they might have come from another person who knows them), we should consider whether their   without permission might infringe their privacy. A public interest justification for breaching these requirements must be classed as ‘exceptional’.  You should seek advice from your department head and, if appropriate, from the managing editor’s office.  You may also need to seek legal advice. You must also be particularly careful not to do anything which could amount to taking advantage of vulnerable adults, which means those who are or may be in need of care services by reason of ‘mental or other disability, age or illness’ and who may be unable to protect themselves against ‘significant harm or exploitation’.  If you are entering a non-public area of a hospital (or similar institution) you will need to obtain permission from a senior executive of the hospital, unless there is a public interest justification for not doing so. Social media provides a wealth of information, some of which may legitimately be used by mainstream media.  However, the internet can present an ethical vacuum and you should not assume that simply because something appears online it can be published by us.  You must make a careful assessment of the veracity of information you find online – and of its apparent origins.  For instance, can you be sure who uploaded the information:  how do you prove that the person who apparently tweeted, commented or uploaded a photograph actually did so themselves? It is also vital to consider whether republication in a major news outlet might invade someone’s privacy.  Some of the things to consider in this regard are: Remember that a person’s right to privacy is not automatically lost simply because material about them has circulated online to some degree. As a journalist employed by or associated with the Group, material which you publish– for example, tweets, blogs, comments and images – helps our titles and websites gain exposure, audience and profile.  However, there is potential for the Group to suffer reputational damage as a consequence of what you publish, even if you intend it only to be in a personal capacity.  Despite the apparent informality and carefree feel of such online activities, they are publications in law and carry all the same implications. If you have concerns about the conduct of another social media user towards you, please raise it immediately with your department head and, if appropriate, the managing editor’s office. See the Social Media and Online Activities Policy for more information. It is the responsibility of every department head, but also everyone working for the Group, whatever their status, to ensure that you follow up anything that might appear to you to be incorrect, even to a minor extent, or which raises any alarm bells from a legal or editorial point of view - whether or not you yourself are responsible for that material.  You should pass any concerns to the managing editor’s office or the Group’s head of legal as appropriate.   AFTER PUBLICATION If you receive any kind of complaint about a story you have been involved with, you should direct complainants to the online complaint forms available on the Evening Standard, Independent and London Live websites – and in serious or urgent cases forward concerns directly to your department head and the managing editor’s office as soon as possible.  You should generally not make any response on your own initiative, however insignificant it might seem.  If you indicate that a remedial course of action might be possible - which could include an apology or correction, promising a change to the online article, or running a letter – this could be construed as an admission of liability on behalf of the Group.  Hence, you should not do so without the express approval of the managing editor’s office or the Group’s head of legal.  You should co-operate fully with any investigations undertaken by the managing editor’s office or the Group’s head of legal in response to such complaints, and make full disclosure of all information, including documentary evidence, in your possession or of which you are aware. If we publish information that turns out to be inaccurate it is important that the position be corrected.  Sometimes an online amendment may be suitable, at other times it may be appropriate to publish a correction or an apology in print or broadcast a statement.  Decisions about remedial action should be made in conjunction with the managing editor’s office and, where appropriate, the Group’s head of legal.

" You, our readers are at the heart of our business; you shape our content by making your voices heard, spark new ideas and offer alternative perspectives.  The guidelines below relate to commenting on stories ‘below the line’ and are intended to ensure the website remains a space for intelligent, free-ranging debate. As a registered member of Independent.co.uk you can: * Comment on content and videos * React to content and videos We won't assume that you support all of our views. Not making assumptions about you is, we hope, a sign of our respect for your views; and we hope that you will show the same respect to other users of our site. That ethic is behind our moderation too. Our moderators strive to be sensitive to context when making decisions. However, large volumes of comments mean it is impractical to enter prolonged conversations over moderating decisions. We reserve the right to delete comments without notification or explanation. To leave a comment on the website, you need to sign up for an account. The easiest way to do this is using a social media account. If you’ve left a comment you want to delete, just click the grey x in the top right corner of the comment and it’ll be deleted.  There’s no way to restore a comment that’s been deleted, and deleting a comment also deletes all of the replies to it.  Keep this in mind when you’re leaving a reply; the person who left the first comment ‘owns’ that thread, and can delete your comment along with their own if they don’t like the tone of the thread.  This is another reason to be respectful of your fellow commenters. If a comment is beyond the pale, and includes a personal attack or insult, it’s possible to flag it to bring it to the attention of the moderators.  You can do this by clicking the flag below the comment. Any user can flag an inappropriate comment. Logging in with Facebook is the easiest way to sign into the website to leave comments and reactions.  We also encourage people to use their real identities when commenting on the site to improve the standards of commenting by making users accountable for what they say. To change the privacy settings or the link between your account and your Facebook account, you can check your application settings  .   Our moderation programme automatically refers for moderation comments which contain certain words. When a comment has been referred for moderation, it is suspended from the site until a moderator has approved it for publication. This process usually takes less than 24 hours. If you notice a comment you've made does not appear on the site immediately, this is likely to be the reason why.  Unless it contains abusive language, or in any other way contravenes our community standards it will reappear on the site within 24 hours.   We make a distinction between lively criticism of an argument, belief or style of writing and attacks on individuals.  Comments that are abusive to other commenters or our journalists will not be tolerated. We will not tolerate sexist, racist, homophobic, and other discriminatory language or views.  Nor comments which are defamatory, malicious, threatening, false, misleading, offensive or abusive.   Comments which incite violence or appear threatening or harassing will also be deleted - and those users banned. Comments which include swear words will automatically be referred for moderation and usually deleted.  Any swearing directed at another user will automatically be deleted (see: ‘Personal attacks’).  Experience has taught us that banning bad language raises the level of debate, so even though we know you’ve heard it all before, please keep it clean!  It’s always frustrating to have to delete an otherwise great comment, because it includes swearing. Please also refrain from posting any content which could be seen to be indecent, obscene or of a sexual nature. Respect the privacy of other commenters and don’t include personal addresses, email addresses, phone numbers or full names in your post.  Do not impersonate another user in your post. In any online community it’s usual for regular commenters to get to know each other and each others’ views.  However please refrain from breaking off from the topic under discussion to engage in personal chats or spats. Flags are an important way for commenters to communicate with the moderator.  Please don’t abuse the flagging function by using it as a weapon in personal vendettas. We think 200 words is enough to develop your argument without disrupting the rhythm of debate. Our moderating system will automatically flag comments from the same user in a single thread if they exceed the frequency limit.  This is intended to encourage interaction and prevent a single user from dominating the debate. If you include a link to another site, please be sure the content complies with these community guidelines and is relevant to the topic.  Any comments including unsuitable links will be deleted, but we should not be assumed to endorse any link which has not been deleted. We reserve the right to protect ourselves from legal action by closing comments on videos reporting on ongoing court cases or otherwise.  We will also delete comments which we deem potentially defamatory or in breach of copyright. Commenters using another video’s comment thread to open discussion on a topic closed to comments will be banned. Please note that you are responsible for your posts and we will not accept any liability for their content or accuracy.  We also reserve the right to republish your posts, which is another reason why we are including your contribution on the clear understanding that your posts are your own work and not copied from others.  By contributing posts you are agreeing to all the above and warranting that your comments are not defamatory, obscene or in breach of anyone else’s rights.  This means generally that you must own the rights in everything you submit or must obtain permission from the rights owner to submit the material. Independent.co.uk is intended as a platform for the exchange of views and ideas.  Comments intended to sell a product or promote commercial interests will be deleted, as will multiple posts. Unfortunately we are not in a position to offer a moderation service for comments in languages other than English.  For simplicity, therefore, comments in languages other than English will be automatically deleted.  This also applies to html code. Comments containing content which is technically harmful (including, without limitation, computer viruses, logic bombs, Trojan horses, worms, harmful components, corrupted data or other malicious software, harmful data or conduct) are not permitted.   Nor is any activity which attempts to get round any protections we put in place for the security and operation of the website. Please do not leave comments which are in breach of these guidelines, our Terms of Use, or any of our other policies.

" Tony Blair was drawn into the NatWest 3 affair yesterday and promised to try to help the three former bankers get bail while they await trial on Enron-related fraud charges in the US. But the Prime Minister and John Reid, the Home Secretary, rejected pleas to block their imminent extradition. In an open letter to Mr Reid, leading business figures, including the chairmen of GlaxoSmithKline, British Airways and the London Stock Exchange, urged him to correct the mistake of a previous home secretary and preserve Britain's ancient tradition of transparent justice. David Bermingham, Gary Mulgrew and Giles Darby have lost a two-year court battle against their extradition and are likely to be locked up in a high-security prison in Houston, Texas, for up to two years while they await trial. They are to be extradited by 17 July. During Prime Minister's Questions in the House of Commons, Mr Blair defended the Government's new extradition arrangements with the US under which the men are due to be flown out. He denied the US was getting preferential treatment. Sir Menzies Campbell, the Liberal Democrat leader, asked him what could be more unfair than the extradition of three bankers without prima facie evidence under a treaty which had been ratified by the US. Laws rushed through in the aftermath of the 11 September 2001 terrorist attacks mean the US no longer has to present a solid prima facie case when making an extradition request while the UK still has to show probable cause. Mr Blair also said he understood the men's concerns and had asked his officials to see whether any support or reassurance could be given over the possibility of being bailed. Legal experts say that because the bankers contested their extradition they would be deemed fugitives from justice and were therefore likely to be refused bail. Even so, the men are in negotiations with the US Department of Justice to secure a bail package that would allow them to come back to the UK to prepare their defence. Mr Bermingham said last week press coverage of the case has been so embarrassing they [the US] consider it a major international incident. The lawyer for the three men, Mark Spragg, ridiculed Mr Blair's promise. Even bail conditions requiring the three's detention in the US will severely impinge their ability to properly prepare themselves for trail, Mr Spragg said. To be bailed in Houston amounts to detention in a larger prison with prettier views. Not only would they be required to pay for their own living and housing expenses in the US, they would be prevented from working to earn their keep, let alone to help support their families ... All these issues fall away were they to be bailed to return to the UK to prepare for trial. Their case was backed in an open letter to the Home Secretary in The Daily Telegraph yesterday which was signed by 39 businessmen and Conservative politicians. They included the retail tycoon Sir Philip Green, the former head of Vodafone and current chairman of GlaxoSmithKline, Sir Christopher Gent, British Airways' chairman, Martin Broughton, The London Stock Exchange's chairman, Chris Gibson-Smith, and the Telegraph Group chairman, Murdoch MacLennan, and Aidan Barclay. They said the treaty was manifestly unfair and highly damaging to our national interest. It added: The Treaty is being used by the US legal system not to capture bombers but to bring to trial in America British business folk. The Home Office rejected the criticism, saying the legislation contains robust safeguards against unfairness. The bankers are accused of plotting with former Enron executives to siphon off $20m (£10.9m) from an Enron vehicle and pocketed $7.3m themselves. The US indictment alleges the trio advised NatWest to sell its stake in the company for $1m. The men deny the charges and want to be tried in the UK. NatWest's parent company, Royal Bank of Scotland, has not pressed any charges. We use cookies to enhance your visit to our site and to bring you advertisements that might interest you.

" Former Australia captain will join up with the national team to assist them for the T20 tri-series with England and New Zealand next month  will join  's coaching staff for next month's Twenty20 tri-series against   and New Zealand. Ponting, who captained his country in the first two editions of the World T20, will act as assistant coach to Darren Lehmann, joining Troy Cooley and Matthew Mott in a new-look backroom team for the short format. Lehmann's regular deputies, David Saker, Brad Haddin and former England batsman Graeme Hick, will all be in South Africa beginning preparations for a four-match Test tour.                        Joe Root was forced to withdraw due to illness after reaching his 50.  Joe Root suffered from gastroenteritis overnight ahead of the fifth day.  Australia celebrate winning back the Ashes.  Steve Smith lifts the Urn to celebrate Australia winning the Ashes.  Ponting, who was recently named head coach of Delhi Daredevils in the Indian Premier League, also worked with the T20 side during a three-match series against Sri Lanka last year. I'm delighted to be involved with the Australian squad again for what should be a terrific series against England and New Zealand, he said. I loved working with the squad last year against Sri Lanka and I can't wait to be working alongside Darren, Troy and Matthew this time around. Watching the KFC Big Bash League in my role as a commentator has shown me we have a wealth of talent available to us in this format and a tri-series like this will give us a great chance to establish a pattern of play that works best for the players. Lehmann welcomed his former team-mate and skipper aboard, adding: Ricky has a fantastic cricket brain and when it comes to Twenty20 cricket there aren't many better in the world given his experience around the world, as a player, a coach and a commentator. It's an exciting prospect for us, as coaches, to have the chance to take advantage of Ricky's Twenty20 knowledge and, for the players, the chance to work with one of Australia's all-time greats will be just as exciting for them.

" England shouldn’t necessarily be winning in Australia on a regular basis, but even in the absurdly grim 1990s they generally managed to leave with something Not the neoteric whitewash, then, but simply a good old-fashioned spanking.   will slip to a 4-0 series defeat in Sydney on Monday – spoiler alert! – the same scoreline by which they lost here in 1958-59. Then, as now, an   written off as little better than ordinary in advance of the series was elevated to surprising heights on the back of an inspirational captain (Richie Benaud) and a battery of young, aggressive fast bowlers.  England, by contrast, fielded an unsatisfactory mix of young players still finding their way in Test cricket, established players struggling for form and a few legends of the game who were some years past their best. It is a paradigm worth bearing in mind when this series finally ends and the bloodletting and introspection truly begins in earnest.  You could, perhaps, glimpse the outline of just such a reckoning when assistant coach   strode in at the close of play on day four to offer his thoughts. The sign of Farbrace being deployed for media duties rather than a player is generally the emblem of a bad day at the office. And once more, England had had a shocker.                         Joe Root was forced to withdraw due to illness after reaching his 50.  Joe Root suffered from gastroenteritis overnight ahead of the fifth day.  Australia celebrate winning back the Ashes.  Steve Smith lifts the Urn to celebrate Australia winning the Ashes.  “In many ways, the last few days have summed up our trip,” Farbrace said. “It’s been exceptionally tough. They’ve kept the pressure on us at all times. But the one thing we’ve talked about is making sure we keep fighting. Because sometimes, when you’re out-skilled, all you can do is keep scrapping.” The choice of words there – “out-skilled” – was both telling and correct. Australia have not been better prepared or better funded than England. They have not been more fortunate with injuries. They have lost four tosses out of five. They have dropped more catches. And yet, by adapting to conditions better, identifying the key passages of play and seizing them, they are about to romp to a fourth comfortable victory.  “A series like this does expose issues in your team,” Farbrace admitted. “And we have a choice. You either churn out some positive stuff. Or we be honest and say that there are certain areas that are not good enough. Everybody needs to look very closely and ask if we have got the right people in the right places, and if we are doing the right things.” It was frank, forthright stuff, and commendable for that, yet still at least two Tests too late. As recently as the build-up to this match, England were continuing to indulge the delusion that they would have been competitive in this series had it not been for Steve Smith. As recently as Melbourne, they were telling themselves and us that the plans were right, the strategy was right, they were doing all the right things, just not for long enough.  Only now does the stark reality appear to have dawned on England: that man for man, they are simply not as good as Australia. Had they grasped that talent deficit much earlier – and to many, it was apparent as early as Adelaide – they might have tailored their tactics accordingly. They might have cultivated the plucky, backs-to-the-wall underdog mentality that could have given them a better chance.  Instead, they tried to do what very few teams have ever succeeded in doing here: bowling long and dry containing spells, ticking over with the bat, trying to attrit Australia rather than blowing them apart. What might an alternative have looked like? Certainly shorter spells for the bowlers – a tactic used to good effect in Brisbane and then inexplicably discarded – would have helped focus minds and energy. Too often England were left with enfeebled bowlers running in on fumes with increasingly eclectic fields. The failure of Moeen Ali to maintain control was clearly a factor here.  England could have been more aggressive against Nathan Lyon – only Joe Root and Dawid Malan have really looked to throw him off his length – and more aggressive with the bat in general, an approach that might have yielded more in game-changing momentum than what it would have cost in wickets. After all, when a boxer is up against a superior opponent, they know the waiting game is futile. They have to go for the knockout. The good thing is that these are the sorts of conversations that England finally look like they are about to have. “We’re always looking at how we can improve,” Farbrace said. “But the key is how honest you are with the conversations you have. Sometimes those conversations have to be brutally honest.  “There’s no point me sitting here chatting about some nice periods of play. Nice periods of play and brief glimpses do not win you Test matches, and they certainly don’t win you Test series in a place like this. And if England are serious about coming back here and winning in four years’ time, the planning needs to start in the next couple of days.” Not all of this lot will still be around in four years.   may not be around in four weeks, having failed once more in exactly the same fashion. Lyon predicted that Australia would “end some careers” this winter, and Vince’s may be the first, even if ironically he is the only England batsman not to be dismissed by Lyon all series. “There’s no doubt that James Vince needs to score more runs if he’s going to play international cricket for England,” Farbrace said. “He’s had some decent starts, shown some glimpses, and we all think: ‘Crikey, this could be the innings’. But there comes a time when ‘this could be the innings’ has to stop, and it’s got to be hundreds. The blunt answer is: he knows he has to score more runs if he’s going to have a future with England.”  will probably get a tour of New Zealand, but has not really looked the same batsman since his working over by Josh Hazlewood in Perth. Once those doubts begin to fester, they can often be hard to banish. Counting in his favour is the lack of viable alternatives, the fact that   is a big fan, and the fact that very few international teams have the capacity to test his technique against the short ball as thoroughly as Australia have here. If he scores runs in New Zealand, he could have a fruitful career.  But in many ways, quibbles over personnel are the easiest part of this exercise. It is the fundamental, structural questions that need to be addressed now. Why is county cricket producing so few 90mph fast bowlers and match-winning spin bowlers? Why do England occasionally look like they have never seen a Kookaburra before? Why are so many of this country’s most talented cricketers playing white-ball cricket only? Does it matter that eight of this England side went to private school? What does it say about England’s well-funded development pathway when their last three batting debutants have been 30, 28 and 29? And why should we have any confidence at all in the decisions being made or the people making them when these are exactly the same conversations we were having four years ago, and some of them seven years before that? England shouldn’t necessarily be winning in Australia on a regular basis. Nobody’s demanding that. But even in the absurdly grim 1990s, when they were up against Waughs and Warne, McGrath and Ponting, they generally managed to leave with something. Here, barring the unlikeliest of miracles, they are set to leave with nothing but a pervading feeling of deja-vu: the sense that history, like a bad curry, is fated to repeat itself.  We use cookies to enhance your visit to our site and to bring you advertisements that might interest you.

" Australian has confirmed he will see out his contract with the ECB but has no plans to extend it  has announced that he will step down as England coach in September 2019 at the end of his current contract. That period takes in the World Cup on home soil and the next   series, and in the wake of their 4-0 Ashes defeat, Bayliss confirmed that while he wants to stay in charge for the time being, he has no intention of going any further than that. “I told [director of  ] Andrew Strauss 12 months ago that I'm contracted to September 2019, and that would see me out,” Bayliss said. “I’ve never been anywhere more than four or five years, whether you're going well or not. I've always felt that it’s time for a change around about that four-year mark. A new voice, a different approach, reinvigorates things.” Bayliss took over as England coach in the summer of 2015, and while he has overseen a transformation in the team’s limited-overs fortunes, England have not won either of the last two global trophies, and have lost more Test matches than they have won. It is not an overstatement to suggest that the next 18 months, which also includes tough series against the world’s No1 side India, will ultimately determine Bayliss’s legacy.                        Joe Root was forced to withdraw due to illness after reaching his 50.  Joe Root suffered from gastroenteritis overnight ahead of the fifth day.  Australia celebrate winning back the Ashes.  Steve Smith lifts the Urn to celebrate Australia winning the Ashes.  Despite the fact that he will not be around for the next Ashes tour in 2021-22, Bayliss said that the process of preparing for the next trip in four years’ time was one that would be undertaken under his watch. “I’ve got no problem working towards a long-term goal even if I’m not going to be there,” he said. “  as captain will still be there, and there’s a base of six or seven players that will still be young enough and good enough to be in the team.” Given that England’s bowling attack was simply not good enough to triumph in Australian conditions, Bayliss admitted that in future young bowlers might need to be blooded earlier, even if it comes at the expense of short-term results. “Winning an away Ashes tour is probably the highlight of anyone's career,” he said. “You would like that to be the focus, but in between you have other big series that you want to win. “How you juggle that and the planning for four years' time is a difficult one. You might blood a young fast bowler in South Africa, or a young spinner in the subcontinent. If we're not as successful as we'd like to be because we're blooding some young players, we have to take that on the chin.” Bayliss was sanguine about England’s 4-0 defeat to Australia, insisting that given injuries and the strength of the opposition, there was little else that could have been done. “Could we have come here with anyone different that could have helped us play any better?” he asked. “I don’t think we could have done. We were outplayed by a good team in their home conditions. You have to give them credit. “We've known for a couple of years that we have been three or four performing players short of a very, very good team. [Dawid] Malan has probably cemented one of the spots. [James] Vince and [Mark] Stoneman will be disappointed that they weren’t able to capitalise. We’ve known for a while that we haven’t got a world-class spinner, and we have to work through that process.”  backed Joe Root to remain captain until England return to Australia in 2021 () Despite their collective failures in Australia, both Stoneman and Vince are due to get one last chance to save their Test careers on the forthcoming tour of New Zealand, the squad for which is due to be announced on Tuesday evening. “Stoneman and Vince do deserve a bit more of a chance,” Bayliss said. “They were playing against one of the best attacks in the world in their home conditions.” We use cookies to enhance your visit to our site and to bring you advertisements that might interest you.

" The Frenchman was subject to similar abuse by Verona fans earlier this week  midfielder   says he was the subject of racial abuse during their 1-0 win at Cagliari on Saturday, days after fellow   side Verona were reprimanded after their supporters directed similar abuse towards the Frenchman. Verona were handed a fine and a suspended partial stadium ban after supporters racially abused the 30-year-old following his opening goal during Juventus’s 3-1 away win on 30 December “Today I experienced racism during the match. Weak people try to intimidate with hate. I am not a hater and can only be sorry for those who set bad examples,” Matuidi wrote on his official Facebook account after Saturday’s game. “Football is a way to spread equality, passion and inspiration and this is what I am here for. Peace.” Matuidi, who has 62 caps for France, joined Juventus before the start of the current season and has scored twice for the Italian champions. Serie A has struggled to stamp out racism in recent years. Last year Pescara midfielder   walked off the pitch at Cagliari following racist abuse from the home crowd. The player was booked for complaining to the referee about the abuse, before walking off the pitch and earning a second yellow card. Muntari later won his fight with Italian football authorities to overturn the one-match he received.

" Real now 16 points off leaders Barcelona after drawing 2-2 with Celta Vigo  players feel like their La Liga title hopes are sinking into a black hole after they let a 2-1 lead against   slip through their fingers in the final eight minutes, leaving them 16 points adrift of leaders Barcelona. Real were leading with eight minutes to go against Celta after  's quick-fire double had overturned  ' opening strike. But  's headed goal in the 82nd minute ensured the match finished in a 2-2 draw and piled more pain on  's side, who had lost 3-0 to arch rivals and runaway leaders Barca in their last Liga outing. At fault for the final goal but very little he could do about the other two  Sent off for an cynical handball in the second half  Did his best but was left wholly exposed for Suarez's opener  Stayed on the pitch - for a change - but isn't the defender he once was anymore  Got forward well early but faded  Left his back four exposed for Suarez's goal. Subbed shortly after  Wasn't his usual self despite starting the game well  Did a job on Messi for large parts of the game but didn't do enough the other way  Not his finest display  Flashed signs of his class but not enough to give his side a way back. Snatched at a couple of chances when passes would have been the better option  Should have done better with first half header. Lacked service as game progressed  Saved well in the first-half but became relatively untroubled  Kept Ronaldo on a relatively short leash and got forward well  His best performance of the season. Excellent  Considering his lack of playing time a tremendous display under pressure  Got forward superbly while always tracking back  Brilliant again. An unsung hero who was often Barca's biggest attacking threat  Excellent against Real's formidable midfield. Created the opener brilliantly  At his powerful best. His composure for the opener set Barca on their way  Not quite the influence he once was but still a classy customer  The main man as ever. Scored the second from the spot before making the third in style  Quiet for large parts but took his goal superbly  It is how it looks from the outside - we are sad, angry and we feel like we are sinking, Brazilian defender   told reporters. It is one of the worst situations I've experienced here. We'll try to work hard and fight so we can win our next game but we don't like this situation at all, it's difficult because the more games you draw or lose the more pressure you are under. The last time Real were 16 points behind the Liga leaders was during  's tension-filled final campaign in 2012-13, when they finished 15 points adrift of Barca. There's nothing else we can do other than keep our heads up and fight and do our best to start winning again, added Marcelo, who has won four La Liga and three Champions League titles since joining Real in 2007. We can't do anything more, we're trying to play good football, to move the ball around and score goals but it's not coming off. Real coach Zidane usually leaps to the defence of his players after negative results but he was not in a forgiving mood on Sunday. The main thing we lacked today was we didn't play the second half, said the Frenchman, who last season guided Real to their first Liga and European Cup double since 1958. We played very well in the first 45 minutes but not in the second half and a game lasts 90 minutes. Zidane also refused to comment on whether or not his side were out of the title race. We're not going to talk about the league every weekend. If we keep losing points we're not going to get there. We have to focus on each game now and try to win them, he said.

" Despite two contentious penalties, Wenger notably did not blame the refereeing decisions afterwards, but blamed his players instead  was furious with his   players after their 4-2   defeat to   on Sunday evening, saying that they were “not good enough anywhere” on the pitch as they kept making the same mistakes. Wenger could only watch from the stands – this was the first game of his touchline ban – as his team was ripped apart by Forest. They could have easily conceded far more than four goals. Despite two contentious penalties, Wenger notably did not blame the refereeing decisions afterwards, but blamed his players instead. “I just think we were not good enough anywhere, not at the  front, not in the middle, at the back and we paid for it,” Wenger said afterwards in his press conference. “They looked sharper, they had more chances, that’s all I can say. Nottingham Forest had an outstanding performance today, you couldn’t fault any individual performance from Forest.” Arsenal could have been 4-0 down at half-time but did not improve after the interval, much to Wenger’s fury. They soon went 3-1 down and could not get back into the game. “You know that when we came back it was important not to make a mistake again,” he said. “And that’s why it’s disappointing. Because during the game we repeated the same mistakes. And that’s where we are guilty today: once, twice, three times. And at that level you cannot afford that.” Wenger made plenty of changes but said that he had enough players – Per Mertsacker, Mathieu Debuchy, Theo Walcott and Danny Welbeck all played – for them to get a result. “I can understand the selection will be questioned but as well,” Wenger said. “But it would be a little bit an easy excuse, because we had eight or nine experienced internationals on the pitch. Even with all the respect, we played against a Championship team and that would be the wrong excuse.” We use cookies to enhance your visit to our site and to bring you advertisements that might interest you.

"  Bakary Sakho's stunning strike looked to have forced a replay after Stephen Dales' opener but Murray's 87th-minute goal clinched victory for the hosts Of course it was Glenn Murray. The Brighton striker bundled in a late winner here at the Amex Stadium to give his side an FA Cup third round win over their arch rivals – and his former club – Crystal Palace. On the night when the Video Assistant Referee made its debut in a competitive match in England, the only thing that needed closely looking at again was Palace’s poor defending as 34-year-old Murray ghosted in at the back post, unmarked, to prod home the winner with two minutes remaining.  Although there were suggestions it may have gone in off his hand, the VAR deemed this was not the case as referee Andre Marriner stuck by his decision to award the goal.  Afterwards Murray insisted: “It wasn’t my arm, I think VAR would have pulled me back if it was. I just needed to get something on it and luckily I did, I think I got my hip or my knee or something on it. As soon as I did it I knew it wasn’t my arm, there was no doubt about it for me.” Bakary Sako had earlier brought Palace level in the second half with a superb strike from distance after Dale Stephens’ first-half opener. The forward’s stunning shot was the only real moment of note in a relatively drab game but as with many Palace performances this season, the visitors came alive after the beak and equalised through Sako’s fifth of the season. The Seagulls had plenty of chances to restore their lead before Murray’s later winner, with substitute Sam Baldock hitting the post in the second half and blazing over when it seemed easier to score. Palace pressed for a late equaliser but Tim Fosu-Mensah and Sako both saw efforts flashed across goal while Berma Kayal also fired over from inside the box down the other end. Just 14,507 turned up to the Amex Stadium to watch the second of three meetings between the two sides this season and in some ways the low turnout was a shame given their famously misunderstood rivalry started in the FA Cup back in 1976. Indeed, this was the first time Palace and Brighton had met each other in the Cup since those fierce meetings 42 years ago. Back then a Brighton penalty was controversially ordered to be re-taken after a Palace player had encroached in the box; the retake was missed and the Eagles won. This time around, though, there was no such controversy for the VAR system to be tested with.  It wasn’t just the Brighton fans who didn’t seem particularly bothered by this late night FA Cup clash, with large segments of the home ends left empty. Both managers made sweeping changes – 12 in all between the two teams. Both managers were also forced into more changes early on as Izzy Brown and Jeffrey Schlupp hobbled off injured and were replaced by Baldock and Pape Souare respectively, the latter making only his third appearance since returning from a year out with a broken jaw and thigh sustained in a car accident. But it was another substitute who settled it, with Murray’s late goal securing Brighton a trip to Middlesbrough in the next round of the Cup.

" Jonjo Shelvey added the third to see the Toon through Ayoze Perez set Premier League Newcastle on their way into the FA Cup fourth round as they launched a first-half blitz to see off battling Luton 3-1. Perez struck twice from close range before Jonjo Shelvey helped himself to a third inside nine minutes to send the Magpies in at the break in compete control. The League Two leaders launched a concerted second-half fightback after Danny Hylton had replied four minutes into the second half and then seen a second ruled out for offside, before substitute Elliot Lee rattled the crossbar with a curling free-kick.           But despite the impressive onslaught, Rafael Benitez's men saw the game through to complete a more than satisfactory festive programme. Keeper Freddie Woodman, making his first senior start for the club, was a little too relaxed when he allowed striker Hylton to get a partial block on his clearance as Luton worked hard to close down early on. Woodman, an Under-20s World Cup-winner with England, did not learn from his error and was almost made to pay three minutes later when Hylton repeated the feat only for team-mate James Collins to mis-control when the ball fell to him. Jacob Murphy forced a diving save from Marek Stech with a curling efforts seconds later and Perez called on the Czech once again with a dipping 21st-minute effort on the turn. But the keeper was at fault as the Magpies took the lead on the half-hour when he spilled Dwight Gayle's driven free-kick and Perez pounced to stab home amid the resulting scramble. Stech was unfortunate to concede for a second time six minutes later when, after making a fine save to keep out Gayle's header, he saw Perez slide home once again to extend his side's lead. The game was effectively over with six minutes of the first half remaining when Perez and Gayle combined to provide Shelvey with the simplest of opportunities to make it 3-0. Midfielder Luke Berry headed over from a Lee corner in stoppage time and saw his shot after he had controlled half-time Harry Cornick's cross blocked by fellow substitute Isaac Hayden two minutes after the restart. The visitors did reduce the deficit when Woodman's scuffed clearance was returned with interest and Hylton rounded the keeper and slotted home with the help of a deflection off covering defender Ciaran Clark. Stech had to make a fine save from point-blank range to deny Perez his hat-trick with 50 minutes gone, but opposite number Woodman was relieved to see the offside flag go up as Hylton fired past him after latching on to a 57th-minute through-ball. Newcastle had allowed their concentration to slip and handed Luton a foothold in a game which was becoming increasingly bad-tempered, and they might have been punished further when Lee crashed a 72nd-minute free-kick against the bar with Woodman rooted to the spot. The Newcastle keeper had to parry Andrew Shinnie's dipping effort with 12 minutes remaining and as they wasted chances to kill off the tie, the Hatters remained in it until the final whistle.

" It was not one for the ages but the Championship side will be pleased to have held Conte's side Premier League champions   were held by Championship side Norwich to a drab 0-0 draw in the FA Cup third round. It was a game with few clear-cut chances on a brisk evening in Norfolk as the Blues - sent out with nine changes from their draw at Arsenal during the week - looked disinterested and off the pace.  were spirited but lacked the quality to cut open the Blues and they'll both have to do it all over again.            The only really interesting thing about a drab first half was Chelsea's choice of third kit; a sort of army camouflage that had been put through the wash too many times. In a way it was apt because the Blues were fairly invisible during the first 45 minutes at Carrow Road while fans on Twitter didn't seem to enamoured with the third kit, which they didn't really need to win seeing as Norwich's famous yellow and green home kit doesn't clash at all. Chelsea's performance reflecting their kit - drab, dull & lacking vitality, said one fan on social media while many noted it's resemblance to Manchester City's third kit in what was literally one of the most interesting talking points on the night. The Premier League title has gone. The Champions League is still on for Chelsea although they face Barcelona in the next round so surely it was a bit of a short-sighted decision to make nine changes for this FA Cup clash at Norwich. The FA Cup and League Cup are the best chances Antonio Conte has of winning a trophy this season so one would have expected him to take is a bit more seriously, but instead he plumped for the likes of Kenedy, David Luiz and even Willy Caballero, who I had no idea had even joined Chelsea in the summer. No wonder their display was so dis-jointed. Michy Batshuayi's future at Stamford Bridge is looking increasingly bleak with reports emerging that Conte is happy to sell him this month. A rare start at Norwich in the cup could have been seen as one last chance from the Italian to prove his worth but Batshuayi didn't take it. He looked lackluster and off the pace, although admittedly so did most of his team-mates. He was replaced by Alvaro Morata with 15 minutes to go on what will in all likeliness be his last start for the Blues. Another player failing to make his mark at Chelsea is Tiémoué Bakayoko who is widely regarded as a bit of a flop following his £40m move from Monaco in the summer. He too was afforded a chance to prove himself to Conte but, like Batsuayi, was a passenger for much of the game.  Much of that will have been down to Norwich's resiliance and organistion but still, against a team that had been a shambles until recent weeks, it was a chance for the Frenchman to prove he was worth his hefty price tag and he didn't take it. Until recently Farke was   over his tough training regime while on the pitch they struggled for a win. Indeed they failed to get a victory at all in November but in recent weeks things have been looking up. Three wins over the festive period have lifted the doom and gloom at Carrow Road and the team to 13th in the table and against Chelsea there were clear signs of that improvement. They were organised and gutsy against their more illustrious opponents and could have nabbed it with Josh Murphy having a hat-trick of chances to win it.

" The Australian press has been responsible for unsettling England during the Ashes with reports of ball-tampering and headbutts - but where is the boundary? And should the British media follow suit?  Three years ago, ahead of the   in Brazil, a few of us were granted an audience in London with  . Before long, somebody had invariably asked him what he made of England’s chances in the tournament. Mourinho pondered for a few moments: not so much over his opinion, but whether he really wanted to divulge it. “England,” he said eventually, “is the kind of team where I am always expecting something good, but I am never surprised when things go wrong. “In every country I know - especially my own country [Portugal] - people live football in a very emotional way. Normally, the press is critical, because everybody has an opinion. The moment the team is chosen and the competition is next door, everybody is together.
                        Joe Root was forced to withdraw due to illness after reaching his 50.  Joe Root suffered from gastroenteritis overnight ahead of the fifth day.  Australia celebrate winning back the Ashes.  Steve Smith lifts the Urn to celebrate Australia winning the Ashes.  “No more critics. Everyone supports, even if you don't agree. Because for a month, the team is a team. I'm not so sure, with the mentality in this country [England], people are ready to go in this direction.” Naturally, a little intellectual glissando may be necessary to overcome the heavy irony in Mourinho pointing the finger at someone else for generating a negative atmosphere or making needless criticisms. And yet there remains a good deal of truth in his words. When it comes to rallying as a nation behind a common cause - including, but not limited to international sport - then for some reason, we seem to struggle. It amuses me when people say that this country has never been more polarised or divided. British society has always divided as easily as a zygote: peasant and landowner, Catholic and Protestant, cavalier and roundhead, town and country, Whig and Tory, Blur and Oasis, people who put the jam on the scone before the cream and the diabolical, hell-bound scum who do the exact opposite. Really, it’s a genuine miracle we’ve only had the one civil war. For this reason, it has been something of an enlightening experience to travel around Australia for the last six weeks, as England’s cricketers have gradually been ground into the dirt by a combination of supreme fast bowling, alien conditions and  ’s mesmerising and unsettling appetite for runs. As well as, yes, the Australian media, whose role as a sort of binding glue in this   triumph has been resolutely minor and yet deliciously overstated. At which point, we should probably draw a subtle distinction between two different sorts of media jingoism. Patriotic drumming from the sidelines is one thing, and even if it occasionally verges on the crass, the tedious or the absurd, it is essentially benign. Witness the  ’s front page on the morning of the Euro ‘96 semi-final against Germany - “ACHTUNG SURRENDER!” - in case you were under any illusions that this is something from which this country is immune. But there is cheerleading, and then there is becoming - or at least attempting to become - an active participant in proceedings. And much of what has emerged from the Australian media over the course of the series has arguably skirted that boundary. What made the furore over  ’s harmless “head-butt” of   in a Perth bar so noteworthy is that it was a story not merely reported, but generated by the media, via creative use of the stump microphone and a couple of tacit leaks. Similarly, the substance-free accusation of ball-tampering against James Anderson sprang not from the match officials or from a formal complaint, but from a smartly-edited piece of Channel Nine footage that the station itself was able to inflate into a story, simply by talking about it again and again. England coach   described it as “a little bit of Pommie-bashing”. In fact, it is analogous to the difference between reporting on a fire, and starting a fire so you can report on it. Underpinning all this is a basic expectation, one that Mourinho would have recognised instantly from his home country: that once battle commences, the media cannot and should not be a dispassionate observer or merely a faithful chronicler, but should instead align itself with the home side, almost become a part of its arsenal. “When you come here you’re playing against everyone, not just the 11 on the field,” England captain   said. “You have to be quite smart, and very switched on to the way they operate.” The question, then, is this: does the press have a duty to “get behind” a national side? And if so, what should the outer limits of this support be? In Britain, where the emblematic power of the back page scoop still holds sway, we are still some way behind (or perhaps ahead) in this regard. Recall the home Test series against South Africa in 2012, and how it was the   that precipitated the implosion of  ’s England captaincy, by printing disparaging text messages about him by  . Would a South African newspaper have printed the same story about   and  , or an Australian newspaper about   and Michael Clarke? I like to think so. But somehow, I doubt it. Of course, the British press is well capable of beating the home drum when it chooses: the  ,  , Wales at Euro 2016. But these are largely exceptions. There are significant elements of our media that are never happier than when they are widening a rift, accelerating a trauma, stirring the pot, and to whom the idea of recalibrating their instincts in order to benefit the national side would scarcely, if ever, occur. This is, I should stress, a difference of culture rather than ethics or morality. I certainly don’t think the British care any more about the freedom and robustness of the press than they do anywhere else. It is, rather, a combination of factors: the existential angst of a post-imperial power, the thirst for gossip that comes from a millennium of rigid class system, and the basic quotidian fatalism of a country where the trains are terrible, the weather is disgusting and Zoella is a published author. As Mourinho put it, we are never quite surprised when things go wrong. All this, of course, is due to come to a head in Russia this summer, where an England side scarred by the memories of Euro 2016 will be under no illusions of the consequences of failure. Will we all find it within ourselves to unite around a flag, a common dream, the shared conviction that   is, in fact, a bit of a dong? Or will our uneasy coalition disintegrate the moment   does a ‘thing’ or Panama score within eight seconds or   buys his mum another house? I think I know, but in the interests of national unity I’ll keep quiet for now. We use cookies to enhance your visit to our site and to bring you advertisements that might interest you.

" Out of the FA Cup already, Arsenal have a crunch EFL Cup semi-final against Chelsea beginning on Wednesday. If they go out then only the Europa League can save their season As surely as December leads into January, the potential positive outcomes for Arsenal’s season are starting to narrow. Stuck back in sixth in the table, 23 points off Manchester City, Arsenal’s Premier League prospects are as grim as ever. On Monday morning they woke up out of the FA Cup too, having launched the worst ever defence of the trophy they won last May. Where does this leave them, moving into the second half of the season? Their only remaining prospects for a trophy are the EFL Cup and the Europa League. Their best players are either heading for the exit or already have one foot out the door. And any hopes at all that this season would be different have long been dashed. Now they are back where they always seem to be, trying to rescue face in the cups given their lack of a serious challenge in the biggest competitions. They have a huge semi-final first leg at Stamford Bridge on Wednesday night, and while the League Cup is not always their priority they simply cannot afford the negative spiral – out of two competitions in a matter of days – from a bad result this week. Too many Arsenal seasons have gone that way in the past, six months of tentative buildup before disappearing down the drain before they can draw breath. But at least they usually make it into February or March.  On Sunday afternoon Wenger took a risk that could start the winter unravelling of the Arsenal season. Taking his team to Nottingham Forest for the FA Cup third round, Wenger rested nine of the first-teamers who had played in Wednesday’s 2-2 draw with Chelsea. But his mixture of youngsters and fringe players were simply not up to the challenge and were destroyed by Forest. Wenger was furious afterwards that his senior internationals – Danny Welbeck, Theo Walcott, Mathieu Debuchy and Per Mertesacker – had not stood up and competed.  Now when Wenger takes his team to Chelsea on Wednesday he will have to bring back Mesut Ozil, Jack Wilshere, Alexandre Lacazette and co into the side. He may have to do without Alexis Sanchez depending on the status of negotiations with Manchester City over his sale. His potential departure, five months overdue, will deprive Arsenal of nominally their best player, and give them another headache in terms of how to replace him. Finding a world-class forward in January is never going to be easy. If there is any faint hope for the season it comes in the Europa League, where Arsenal play Ostersunds FK in the last-32 next month. They are just eight games away from the final in Lyon on 16 May and while that may sound fanciful, the reality of their season is that it may be their best way of playing Champions League football next season. They would need a dramatic league upturn – in which they is no reason to trust – or collapses from two Manchester United, Liverpool or Chelsea for them to scrape into the top four. There was a point for Manchester United last season when they realised that there was more hope of winning the Europa League than finishing fourth, and Jose Mourinho started to re-deploy resources accordingly. Arsenal’s only hope of anything resembling success is to stay in the hunt, start focusing on Europe and then to triumph in France once the Premier League season is over. It is a bad place for Arsenal to be in, relying on treading a long tightrope all the way to Lyon just to salvage their season. But then when Wenger signed his two-year extension last summer, did anyone expect this year to be any different?  This is just how the last string of Arsenal seasons have gone and with the same manager and same players – and competing against strengthening rivals – this was always going to happen. The question, as Arsenal had into another transitional summer, and this one worse than the last, is whether they can ever make the real change needed to compete again? Or if this same sensation of dwindling possibilities will be felt again this time next year. We use cookies to enhance your visit to our site and to bring you advertisements that might interest you.

"  In 2011, the Afghan women's captain was forced to flee her own country in fear for her life. Today she is a global icon. This is her story  In April 2011,   thought she was going to die. “I was facing regular death threats from the  , and I knew that if I stayed in   my life would have been in real danger,” she says softly. “I had a choice — I could either stay in my own country and face the consequences, or leave and continue working towards my goal. And I didn’t want to die.” It is a beautiful winter’s day in Monte Carlo and, as she recounts the darkest moments of her life, hotel guests mingle happily, sipping cocktails ordered from an expensive menu. When Popal first took to the football pitch — long before rising to become the captain of the Afghanistan national women’s team — she could never have imagined that she would end up here. Now, Popal lives in Denmark having sought asylum in the country, and travels the world speaking out on behalf of those who cannot defend themselves. But she began playing football in silence. In the city of Kabul, she and her friends would play in a secluded yard in the shadow of their school, careful to keep the noise to a minimum. The Taliban began growing in influence during Popal’s early years, spreading an ultra-conservative ideology that heavily restricted individual freedoms. It was not long before women were banned from participating in sport or attending stadiums altogether. “I started to play football simply because it was fun,” Popal recounts. “But it was not long before it became a lot more serious than that. They said that it was not good for me to play football and that it dishonoured me.” The forbidden kickabouts grew in number as more girls joined in and, encouraged by their swelling numbers, Popal and her friends defiantly took to the public playing fields. But although the Taliban occupation of Afghanistan officially ended in 2001, the hardline mentality of the group remained. Large swathes of the community turned on the girls, throwing stones at them as they played and declaring them “prostitutes” simply for playing the sport they loved. “Afghanistan is a very traditional country,” Popal explains. “It’s a very closed country when it comes to women and honour killings are common. But it’s not just the Taliban, it is the Taliban   which is still common in society to this day. “There are people going to work in smart suits who look like gentlemen, but in reality their mentality is so, so against women. And unfortunately these types of people do not want to support our rights. What is even worse is that this Taliban mentality still exists among some people in the government, too, and they are creating a lot of problems for women, and making it difficult for them to develop or to function in society.” Despite the adversity they faced, Popal and her friends did find a handful of allies and the local   base allowed them to train at their compound — so long as they scarpered whenever a helicopter needed to land. In 2007 the national women’s football was formed, with their first ever match against an International Security Assistance Forces XI. They won 5-0. Yet even the fledgling team’s achievements were interwoven with tragedy. The landmark fixture took place at the Ghazi Stadium, where Taliban officials had previously carried out stonings, amputations and executions in accordance with Sharia law. Locals whispered that so much blood had soaked deep into the turf that the grass would no longer grow. “Whenever I kicked the ball there I could not stop my mind from racing and imagining,” Popal says. “I had seen photos and videos of what had happened there before. I knew that this was the place for public executions and that so many women had died on this very field. And I knew that those things had happened in exactly the place where I was now kicking a football.” She pauses briefly. “But also, every single time that I kicked the ball it felt like a victory for all of the women who had died, and all of the women who had been unable to stand up for their rights. Who had been made victims for no reason. So breaking the barrier of playing there was very important and we were all proud to make history.” International matches against the likes of Nepal, Pakistan and the Maldives followed. But her success came at a price. The death threats intensified, with Popal’s family also made to fear for their safety, and a vicious smear campaign was launched to discredit her. Eventually, Popal felt she had no choice but to quietly flee the nation she had fought so hard to represent. “When I started playing football, or even when I made the decision to begin taking football more seriously, I truly never thought that one day it would lead to me leaving. I went as far as I could but in the end I felt I no longer had enough support to remain there. “People threatened my life and I did not want to die, because I knew if I did then generations of women after me would live with this fear. And I did want this to stop them from playing football. So I chose to leave the country and live, and still continue fighting for my own gender.” Weeks on the road followed. Without a visa, Popal nervously edged her way across Pakistan, before going underground in India. Eventually she managed to make her way to an asylum centre in Norway and from there she crossed into Denmark, where she waited at another centre for months, depressed and alone. Popal needed to draw on every ounce of her inner strength to persevere. “I’m the sort of person who hates to give up,” she says resolutely, as if the past 20-minutes of conversation have left this statement in any doubt. “And I never want to see myself weak — no matter what happens I hate to see myself weak. I’m afraid to be weak and I’m afraid of what it feels like to give up.” But there was a time when she almost did. A life-affirming opportunity to play for a local team turned sour when, having not long dusted off her boots, Popal suffered a serious knee injury which ended her career. She had risked everything for football, only for the sport to let her down when she needed it the most. “I arrived in Denmark struggling to adjust to an entirely different culture and language, and had no friends, no network, nothing. And then I suffered my injury, with my knee totally damaged, and I was told I could not continue playing football. So it was a time when I did seriously think about all the things that had happened to me, and I came close to giving up.” Fortunately, she didn’t. “I said no,” she adds. “I knew that there had to be something else. There had to be a Plan B, something that would allow me to continue working towards my dream. And I realised that it was okay if I couldn’t play football, I could still support other women who can play, and who dream of having the kind of opportunities and support that I never had.” Although there is no longer any chance of her adding to her 20-appearances for the national team, Popal remains a key figure in Afghan women’s football and currently serves as their Programme Director. She has also established her own organisation — Girl Power — which works to promote sports participation among minority groups, as well as co-operating with   and  . And last year she worked closely with Hummel, helping the Danish sportswear company to design a lightweight sports hijab, to increase the opportunities of the women who chose to wear one. Popal hopes it will encourage even more Muslim women to become engaged in the sport. A post shared by   (@hummelsport) on  “When I started working with Hummel it was at the request of some of the Afghan players, because some of our players want to wear the hijab when they play and for some it is the only way their families will allow them to play. “The project has obviously been quite complicated and political at times, but the idea behind it is very simple: how do we give more opportunities to young women in Afghanistan and everywhere? How can we encourage them out from their homes? We wanted to provide support for women to make their own choices with something they would feel comfortable wearing and we wanted to show that football is not against religion or culture. It is just about having fun, enjoying the game and enjoying being together.” The hotel has fallen quiet and it is beginning to get dark outside: Popal has an awards ceremony to attend. Peace and Sport have named her their Champion of the Year, a prestigious award which recognises the extraordinary effort she has made towards peaceful change in the world. She is a global inspiration — and yet hopes that soon her example will not need to be followed. “It really is my dream that, at some point in the future, there will be nobody like me,” she smiles, as she heads towards the door. “I hope that there will not be a person who has been left totally alone, all by herself. The thing I love more than anything is women supporting women and that is what I want to happen in the future.” We use cookies to enhance your visit to our site and to bring you advertisements that might interest you.

" The 28-year-old striker was given just his third start under David Moyes against West Brom as the Hammers came from behind to win 2-1 Andy Carroll is hoping his two goals that saw West Ham   will help him seal a firm place in the side’s starting lineup – a situation that's left him frustrated on the bench. The striker scored his first goal in nine months, and followed it up with a second in the dying seconds of injury time, to clinch a vital victory for the Hammers, taking them out of the relegation zone. “It was fantastic,” said Carroll, “The lads were over the moon; the fans were over the moon. I think it was a great atmosphere.” Carroll, whose career in East London has been tainted with injury troubles, admits he’s not best pleased sitting on the bench under new boss David Moyes, and wanted to use the game to prove his worth. “It’s been very frustrating,” he admitted, “I’ve been sitting on the bench – it’s been tough. I’ve been wanting to play. I’ve been wanting to get there and start. It’s hard when you’re coming on for the last 20 minutes.” “I don’t want to be an impact player coming off the bench,” He added. “Tonight when I was called upon I felt like I needed to show what I was about and try and get back into the starting 11, and push myself back into a starting place.” The 28-year-old was quick to praise both strike partner Marko Arnautovic and captain Mark Noble for their performances – the latter of which was brought on at half time after James McClean put the visitors ahead. “I think going one-nil down was tough,” said Carroll. “I thought Nobes [Noble] changed the game for us. He kept the ball, he dominated in midfield and defended well and brought everyone into the game. I thought it was fantastic, and changed the game for us.” After a failed deadline day move to Manchester City in the summer, the Chilean forward has refused to sign a contract with the London-based club, and will have a host of top European sides after him in January or the summer.  The German playmaker’s protracted contract negotiations are well documented, and he will have a host of suitors should he fail to resign for the Gunners before the summer. Arsenal FC via  The United playmaker is yet to renew his contract with the club, however having started 13 games this season, it seems unlikely the Spaniard will be shown the door by Mourinho.  Following strong criticism from his own manager and pundits, after a series of long-term injuries, the former-Saint looks set to leave Old Trafford after four seasons that has seen him make only 53 appearances for United. Man Utd via  Manchester United have a one-year option they can invoke in the Spaniard’s contract should they wish to extend his stay at Old Trafford. Nemanja Matic’s arrival has limited the midfielder’s opportunities with the majority of his appearances this season coming from the bench. Man Utd via  Having struggled with injuries for years the Arsenal academy graduate has played in Arsenal’s previous four games. Undoubtedly talented, should the midfielder reject a proposed contract extension from the London club he will have plenty of Premier League sides eager to sign him at the end of the season. Arsenal FC via  Heavily linked with a move to Juventus, the former-Bayern Munich midfielder has been frustrated by Jurgen Klopp’s rotation policy in a congested Liverpool midfield, and with the impending arrival of Naby Keita from Leipzig in the summer, sees his opportunities further diminishing. Liverpool FC via  Struggling for game time in a United midfield consisting of Paul Pogba, Ander Herrera, and Nemanja Matic, the Belgian may be tempted to move in search of first team opportunities.  The Champions League winner, now 34, has struggled with injury this season, and has understandably looked rusty upon his return to the Bayern starting eleven. Bongarts/ While the midfielder is out of contract next summer, it is believed that Guardiola is keen for the City hierarchy to offer the 32-year-old Brazilian a new contract.  Having made only 13 appearances for Mourinho’s side in all competitions this season, the versatile Dutchman has been linked with a move to Barcelona.  Following his conversion to full-back by manager Jose Mourinho, the 32-year-old has scored twice and provided four assists with his dangerous delivery from out wide. Teams in the Premier League will be keen to secure the former Aston Villa player’s experience next term. Man Utd via  At 33 the Italian centre-back is still a world-class player, and with less than a year on his contract, will surely be a bargain for whoever secures his services next summer.  Undoubted class, but at 36, whether the Swede represents value for money is another matter, with the striker one of the highest paid players in the Premier League.  The former Liverpool striker has had to settle for a place on the bench since his return to Atletico Madrid, behind Antoine Griezmann and Kevin Gameiro in the pecking order. A move away surely beckons for the 33-year-old.  Former-Spurs flyer Lennon has not been offered a new contract by current club Everton, but will certainly add Premier League know-how to promoted sides looking to avoid relegation next season.  Bayern’s other veteran winger has also had an injury-stricken season in Bavaria, though has still managed to score three and assist four in all competitions. The Dutchman is certainly still a threat when fully fit. Bongarts/ Having won the Champions League three times, Casillas is certainly a high-quality goalkeeper. Could the Spanish veteran be a good signing for a top-European club?  Blighted by serious injuries to his Achilles and having had surgery nine times in 14 months, the diminutive midfielder will hope to regain his fitness to restart his career. Arsenal FC via  The pacey winger has enjoyed a four year spell in Ukraine with Shakhtar Donetsk, though in not signing a new contract, may have his heart set on playing in one of Europe’s top five leagues.  The enigmatic Italian striker has reignited his stop-start career in Nice with 33 goals in 49 appearances for the French side.  Talent in abundance though lacking work rate, teams interested in the attacker will hope they can see the player find the form he displayed at OGC Nice, scoring 18 goals and assisting 7 in 2015/16.  The stocky Argentine forward has been on fire this season in the Chinese Super League, scoring 20 goals and assisting 19 in 27 games. A return to Europe is surely on the cards for the former-Napoli man.  Displaced from the Everton starting line-up by £30m summer arrival Jordan Pickford, the Spaniard will be eager to guarantee himself more game-time should next year.  The Atletico Madrid legend, now 32, is under increasing competition from Croatian full-back Sime Vrsaljko and could be tempted by a move before retirement.  The Ajax forward, currently sidelined with a serious knee injury, had an excellent season in 2016/17 and was rewarded with his first Germany cap by Joachim Lowe in June this year.  The French target-man has enjoyed the most prolific spell of his career with Mexican side Tigres UANL, scoring a goal in every two games in all competitions. Proven in Ligue 1 with Marseille, the striker is capable of succeeding in Europe.  Capable of dictating games at the top-level, the Frenchman could surely be a wildcard for a top side in the Premier League next season.  Winner of Ligue 1 with AS Monaco last year, the 31-year-old midfielder is into the final year of his contract.  The box-to-box midfielder has had an excellent start to the season, scoring 4 goals from central midfield for Schalke. The German international has been linked with moves to top European sides Barcelona and Juventus. Bongarts/ The Mexican wideman has found goals hard to come by this season, scoring just once this season for Real Sociedad.  After years of speculation that Toure would leave Manchester City, the Ivorian’s time at City finally seems to coming to an end.  Liverpool have been linked to the Netherland’s international in recent weeks as Jurgen Klopp seeks to add quality to his defence.  The Bundesliga winner has made only four appearances this season, often failing to even make the bench for Dortmund.  The 22-year-old playmaker Meyer has been consistently linked with Liverpool, Tottenham and Barcelona and has so far refused any contract offers made by Schalke. Bongarts/ The Spanish midfielder has been a mainstay for SD Eibar over the past three seasons. Offering a goal-threat from midfield with his long-distance shooting and set-piece ability, Garcia could prove a shrewd acquisition.  The Moroccan full back has deputised well for Dani Carvajal in La Liga this season, and has shown glimpses of his potential at the Bernabeu.  Disappointing performances for the Bianconeri this season, and added competition from Mattia de Sciglio have led to rumours that the Swiss defender could be set to leave Turin in January.  The 25-year-old defender has guided FC Porto to the top of the Primeira Liga, conceding only six goals in the process.  Still only 20, the Turkish forward has seen his career stall since moving to Spain from Manchester City. Should the striker fail to sign a new contract with Villareal, a move back to the Eredivisie could prove fruitful for a striker with vast potential.  The experienced Brazilian right-back is entering the last year of his contract with Bayern Munich. Capable of deputising at the top level, and with invaluable experience in the Champions league, the 32-year old could provide excellent cover for an elite European side next season. Bongarts/ The Porto centre-back, also capable of playing left-back, has been the subject of interest from Everton following a number of impressive displays for the Iberian club.  Former Atletico Madrid star Miranda has started all but one league game for Inter Milan this term helping his side keep eight clean sheets so far. Should he fail to renew his contract with the Nerazzuri, he will be a top acquisition for any side.  The 23-year-old goalkeeper is yet to sign a new deal with Athletic Bilbao, and is rumoured to be close to agreeing a move to Real Madrid for €20m.  The five-time Serie A winner is capable of playing in a variety of positions and would certainly be a valuable squad player for top sides in Europe.  The 26-year-old striker has been in excellent form for Hoffenheim this season, scoring 12 goals in all competitions. Bongarts/ Injured since the summer, the experienced right winger would be a gamble with such little game time in the past year. If he can prove his fitness, the winger is capable of creating chances from wide areas, with six assists last season in La Liga.  The Spanish playmaker is yet to agree a new contract and has proven, when fit, that he is capable of playing at the top level.  The Werder Bremen creative midfielder has assisted 49 in 182 appearances, scoring 20 goals in the process. Bongarts/ Just three points currently separate Brighton in 12th and Stoke in 18th, with West Ham sitting in amongst those teams just a point adrift of the drop zone in 16th.  “Down at the bottom it’s very tight, it’s nice to pull away,” Carroll said. “We just need to continue that, continue the results, and continue working like we did tonight.” “I think we know the quality in our dressing room and we’re confident that we will not be going down,” he added. “We’ll be getting out of it. At the minute it is tough down there but we’ve still got the quality and the confidence. “We are on a decent run at the minute, so hopefully it continues.” West Ham face Tottenham at Wembley on Thursday, with the Hammers having previously beaten their hosts in the Carabao Cup back in October.

" The club-record £27m signing is yet to score in 12 appearances this season Roy Hodgson has warned the goalless Christian Benteke he is willing to use Bakary Sako as a striker and that Crystal Palace cannot afford to carry anyone. The club-record £27m signing is yet to score in 12 appearances this season, and despite being their only senior recognised striker, is under growing pressure after Sako came off the bench against Watford to score. Hodgson had begun to convert Sako from a winger while Benteke was injured, and on Tuesday he scored a poacher's goal when being the first to react to rebounds from Heurelho Gomes' saves. Despite Hodgson's team having a convincing attacking threat at Selhurst Park, they are yet to score away from home in 2017/18, a concern that could be intensified when on Saturday they visit Leicester. Sako has done well and he scored a good goal by following the ball in, said the 70-year-old manager. He did that and when the goalkeeper couldn't hold it, he scored from the rebound. We haven't been following the ball in as well as we'd like. It's something we preach but don't always actually manage to produce, but he did. He followed the shot in, and when the goalkeeper couldn't hold it he scored from the rebound. That alone is something we find very positive. He has improved in terms of his understanding of what we want from him. He gets closer and closer and I am not afraid to use him. It didn't surprise me that he scored that goal. Asked about Benteke, who on Saturday against Bournemouth was so desperate to score he ignored team orders to take a late penalty he missed, Hodgson said: Of course him not scoring is a concern to us, him and the fans. He needs to keep working hard and make a good contribution to the team. We can't afford to carry anyone, let alone a goalscorer who isn't scoring goals. We won't keep reminding him about it. I wouldn't be gaining a great deal by doing that. Christian   has struggled for form and goals this season () Palace travel to Leicester without injured central defenders Mamadou Sakho and Damien Delaney, and full-backs Timothy Fosu-Mensah and Joel Ward, at a time when the hosts have won their past four fixtures. Martin Kelly is expected to deputise for Fosu-Mensah and Ward at right-back, and Hodgson said: Leicester are a good team with good players and Claude Puel has done well. It is no surprise they are doing well; it is not that long ago they were the champions of England. We have to be respectful of them and fear the quality they have. We would have been, even without their recent results. We use cookies to enhance your visit to our site and to bring you advertisements that might interest you.

At kick-off they remained 20th and desperate for all three points, but in a disastrous start their lack of concentration was punished by the visitors when   headed them into the lead in the third minute. Their improved intensity went without reward to the extent that when   was sent off in the 87th minute they would have settled for a point.  instead scored their equalising goal in the 89th minute, and fellow substitute   secured an unlikely victory with his stoppage-time finish. The in-form   was gifted as much time and space to cross from the left wing as Janmaat was to convert it, and after the Brazilian's classy, curling delivery, the defender headed into the top right corner from in front of goal. He had returned to Watford's starting XI following an injury to  , and amid their switch to a back three thrived out wide and again threatened when he forced his way into the area before stabbing wide of the left post.

" McTominay was born in Lancaster but qualifies for Scotland through his father, though the youngster has yet to make his allegiances clear  thinks   team-mate   can become an England star - a suggestion which may not be welcomed by the Scottish Football Association. Matic has joined the 21-year-old midfielder's growing fan club having joined him on the field in his first Premier League start of the season against Bournemouth in midweek. McTominay was born in Lancaster but qualifies for Scotland through his father, who spoke to interim manager Malky Mackay about a potential call-up to face Holland last month. He has yet to make his allegiances clear, instead opting to focus on breaking in at Old Trafford, but Matic believes the sky is the limit. He has exactly what he needs to become a big player, Matic told MUTV. He's working a lot every day and is looking to the older players to take things from them and to learn and I'm sure that he will be an England star and a Manchester United star because I think he is born for this job. The manager is there to explain to someone like Scott what he needs to do and I'm really happy for him because he's a good guy and I'm sure in the future he will get more chances to play and show his qualities. McTominay is likely to return to bench duty for Sunday's trip to West Brom but Matic has no doubt his growth will continue as long as he focuses on the job at hand.  in action for Swansea (Manchester United) The Serbia international has pledged to do whatever he can to make his young colleague's transition easier but does not see himself as a direct role model. When I was young I just tried to, let's say, copy the older players - how they work and how they were as professionals, he said. (But) we are all different, you cannot try to do what the other players do because one player has one quality and you might have another. I think the young players just need freedom, you don't need to put extra pressure on them because they feel the pressure when they're on the pitch playing for Manchester United. They have enough pressure, so you have to try to release them a little bit and then they can show all their quality.

" The 56-year-old, who has been accused of bullying and racism by academy players, was called to a meeting with managing director Lee Charnley and head of safeguarding Steve Swinyard on Monday An investigation into allegations made against   under-23s coach Peter Beardsley is ongoing after the former Magpies striker met club officials. The 56-year-old, who has been accused of bullying and racism by academy players, was called to a meeting with managing director Lee Charnley and head of safeguarding Steve Swinyard on Monday. It's understood no decision was made and further evidence will be heard from the complainants later this week. There was no comment from Newcastle on Monday evening, when the under-23s' scheduled clash with Middlesbrough was postponed because of bad weather. Sources revealed at the weekend that 22-year-old midfielder Yasin Ben El-Mhanni had lodged a complaint of bullying against former England international Beardsley, and it has since emerged that further allegations have been made. El-Mhanni is understood to be due to attend a grievance hearing later this week. Beardsley made more than 300 appearances for his home-town club in two spells during a glittering career which also took him to Manchester United, Liverpool, Everton and Manchester City. Following his retirement, he was offered a coaching role on Tyneside and in 2003 he and academy director Kenny Wharton were cleared after a Premier League inquiry into allegations of bullying made by youth players James Beaumont and Ross Gardner. Beardsley left the club in 2006 but having returned in an ambassadorial role following Mike Ashley's takeover, was appointed as an academy coach once again in 2009.

" revealed last month that the Reds were preparing a £90m move for the winger  have no intention of selling   during the January transfer window, shortening  ’s list of replacements for the seemingly  -bound  . Reports in December suggested the Reds would turn to Lemar to continue their January transfer splurge after splashing out a world record fee for a defender on  , amid interest from both Chelsea and   for the winger. Arsenal had a fee agreed for the 22-year-old on deadline day last year, only for him to reject the Gunners, thus causing the collapse of  ’s move to   – a similar situation that Liverpool now find themselves in with Coutinho. After a failed deadline day move to Manchester City in the summer, the Chilean forward has refused to sign a contract with the London-based club, and will have a host of top European sides after him in January or the summer.  The German playmaker’s protracted contract negotiations are well documented, and he will have a host of suitors should he fail to resign for the Gunners before the summer. Arsenal FC via  The United playmaker is yet to renew his contract with the club, however having started 13 games this season, it seems unlikely the Spaniard will be shown the door by Mourinho.  Following strong criticism from his own manager and pundits, after a series of long-term injuries, the former-Saint looks set to leave Old Trafford after four seasons that has seen him make only 53 appearances for United. Man Utd via  Manchester United have a one-year option they can invoke in the Spaniard’s contract should they wish to extend his stay at Old Trafford. Nemanja Matic’s arrival has limited the midfielder’s opportunities with the majority of his appearances this season coming from the bench. Man Utd via  Having struggled with injuries for years the Arsenal academy graduate has played in Arsenal’s previous four games. Undoubtedly talented, should the midfielder reject a proposed contract extension from the London club he will have plenty of Premier League sides eager to sign him at the end of the season. Arsenal FC via  Heavily linked with a move to Juventus, the former-Bayern Munich midfielder has been frustrated by Jurgen Klopp’s rotation policy in a congested Liverpool midfield, and with the impending arrival of Naby Keita from Leipzig in the summer, sees his opportunities further diminishing. Liverpool FC via  Struggling for game time in a United midfield consisting of Paul Pogba, Ander Herrera, and Nemanja Matic, the Belgian may be tempted to move in search of first team opportunities.  The Champions League winner, now 34, has struggled with injury this season, and has understandably looked rusty upon his return to the Bayern starting eleven. Bongarts/ While the midfielder is out of contract next summer, it is believed that Guardiola is keen for the City hierarchy to offer the 32-year-old Brazilian a new contract.  Having made only 13 appearances for Mourinho’s side in all competitions this season, the versatile Dutchman has been linked with a move to Barcelona.  Following his conversion to full-back by manager Jose Mourinho, the 32-year-old has scored twice and provided four assists with his dangerous delivery from out wide. Teams in the Premier League will be keen to secure the former Aston Villa player’s experience next term. Man Utd via  At 33 the Italian centre-back is still a world-class player, and with less than a year on his contract, will surely be a bargain for whoever secures his services next summer.  Undoubted class, but at 36, whether the Swede represents value for money is another matter, with the striker one of the highest paid players in the Premier League.  The former Liverpool striker has had to settle for a place on the bench since his return to Atletico Madrid, behind Antoine Griezmann and Kevin Gameiro in the pecking order. A move away surely beckons for the 33-year-old.  Former-Spurs flyer Lennon has not been offered a new contract by current club Everton, but will certainly add Premier League know-how to promoted sides looking to avoid relegation next season.  Bayern’s other veteran winger has also had an injury-stricken season in Bavaria, though has still managed to score three and assist four in all competitions. The Dutchman is certainly still a threat when fully fit. Bongarts/ Having won the Champions League three times, Casillas is certainly a high-quality goalkeeper. Could the Spanish veteran be a good signing for a top-European club?  Blighted by serious injuries to his Achilles and having had surgery nine times in 14 months, the diminutive midfielder will hope to regain his fitness to restart his career. Arsenal FC via  The pacey winger has enjoyed a four year spell in Ukraine with Shakhtar Donetsk, though in not signing a new contract, may have his heart set on playing in one of Europe’s top five leagues.  The enigmatic Italian striker has reignited his stop-start career in Nice with 33 goals in 49 appearances for the French side.  Talent in abundance though lacking work rate, teams interested in the attacker will hope they can see the player find the form he displayed at OGC Nice, scoring 18 goals and assisting 7 in 2015/16.  The stocky Argentine forward has been on fire this season in the Chinese Super League, scoring 20 goals and assisting 19 in 27 games. A return to Europe is surely on the cards for the former-Napoli man.  Displaced from the Everton starting line-up by £30m summer arrival Jordan Pickford, the Spaniard will be eager to guarantee himself more game-time should next year.  The Atletico Madrid legend, now 32, is under increasing competition from Croatian full-back Sime Vrsaljko and could be tempted by a move before retirement.  The Ajax forward, currently sidelined with a serious knee injury, had an excellent season in 2016/17 and was rewarded with his first Germany cap by Joachim Lowe in June this year.  The French target-man has enjoyed the most prolific spell of his career with Mexican side Tigres UANL, scoring a goal in every two games in all competitions. Proven in Ligue 1 with Marseille, the striker is capable of succeeding in Europe.  Capable of dictating games at the top-level, the Frenchman could surely be a wildcard for a top side in the Premier League next season.  Winner of Ligue 1 with AS Monaco last year, the 31-year-old midfielder is into the final year of his contract.  The box-to-box midfielder has had an excellent start to the season, scoring 4 goals from central midfield for Schalke. The German international has been linked with moves to top European sides Barcelona and Juventus. Bongarts/ The Mexican wideman has found goals hard to come by this season, scoring just once this season for Real Sociedad.  After years of speculation that Toure would leave Manchester City, the Ivorian’s time at City finally seems to coming to an end.  Liverpool have been linked to the Netherland’s international in recent weeks as Jurgen Klopp seeks to add quality to his defence.  The Bundesliga winner has made only four appearances this season, often failing to even make the bench for Dortmund.  The 22-year-old playmaker Meyer has been consistently linked with Liverpool, Tottenham and Barcelona and has so far refused any contract offers made by Schalke. Bongarts/ The Spanish midfielder has been a mainstay for SD Eibar over the past three seasons. Offering a goal-threat from midfield with his long-distance shooting and set-piece ability, Garcia could prove a shrewd acquisition.  The Moroccan full back has deputised well for Dani Carvajal in La Liga this season, and has shown glimpses of his potential at the Bernabeu.  Disappointing performances for the Bianconeri this season, and added competition from Mattia de Sciglio have led to rumours that the Swiss defender could be set to leave Turin in January.  The 25-year-old defender has guided FC Porto to the top of the Primeira Liga, conceding only six goals in the process.  Still only 20, the Turkish forward has seen his career stall since moving to Spain from Manchester City. Should the striker fail to sign a new contract with Villareal, a move back to the Eredivisie could prove fruitful for a striker with vast potential.  The experienced Brazilian right-back is entering the last year of his contract with Bayern Munich. Capable of deputising at the top level, and with invaluable experience in the Champions league, the 32-year old could provide excellent cover for an elite European side next season. Bongarts/ The Porto centre-back, also capable of playing left-back, has been the subject of interest from Everton following a number of impressive displays for the Iberian club.  Former Atletico Madrid star Miranda has started all but one league game for Inter Milan this term helping his side keep eight clean sheets so far. Should he fail to renew his contract with the Nerazzuri, he will be a top acquisition for any side.  The 23-year-old goalkeeper is yet to sign a new deal with Athletic Bilbao, and is rumoured to be close to agreeing a move to Real Madrid for €20m.  The five-time Serie A winner is capable of playing in a variety of positions and would certainly be a valuable squad player for top sides in Europe.  The 26-year-old striker has been in excellent form for Hoffenheim this season, scoring 12 goals in all competitions. Bongarts/ Injured since the summer, the experienced right winger would be a gamble with such little game time in the past year. If he can prove his fitness, the winger is capable of creating chances from wide areas, with six assists last season in La Liga.  The Spanish playmaker is yet to agree a new contract and has proven, when fit, that he is capable of playing at the top level.  The Werder Bremen creative midfielder has assisted 49 in 182 appearances, scoring 20 goals in the process. Bongarts/  revealed last month that Liverpool would move for Lemar, and that he favoured a move to Anfield rather than the Emirates, but head coach   has dismissed that as a possibility this month. “Monaco are not in the habit of making big sales in the winter,” Jardim said. “It’s our strategy. The players understand and they know how it goes here.” However, Liverpool still could test the water with a £90m-plus bid as the club do not want to be in a situation where any sale leaves them short of options.

" What you need to know about Hanukkah - also known as Chanukah and the festival of lights. The spelling differs as it's a translation of a Hebrew word. They say every major Jewish holiday can be summed up by the following quote: 'They tried to kill us, we won, let's eat.' In the case of  , the story is that of the Maccabees, a guerrilla army of Jewish rebels based in Israel who revolted against the Seleucid Greek King Antiochus who had - as the saying goes - tried to kill us. The exact historical truth of the religious version of events is disputed, but we do know that King Antiochus and the Maccabees existed. What is less established is whether the miracle described in the Hanukkah story really happened. Jewish people are taught that the oppressed Maccabees somehow defeated Antiochus' mighty troops and reclaimed the Temple in Jerusalem. To celebrate, they attempted a ritual lighting of a seven-pronged Menorah candle - but they only had enough oil to last one day. Miraculously, the oil lasted a full eight days, giving Jews enough time to procure new oil. This is why Hanukkah is known as the festival of lights. Around 2,000 years on, Jewish people celebrate Hanukkah by lighting their Menorah every night for eight days - with the crucial difference being that modern Menorahs - also known as Hanukkiahs - have eight prongs with a large prong, known as a shamash, in the middle. The shamash is used to light one extra candle each night for the eight days. Observing in public is a key part of celebrating the festival. Jewish people are encouraged to place the Menorah in the front window of their home, and some organisations have organised public Menorah lightings.  A modern menorah with seven prongs   Now for the most important part, the food. The story of Hanukkah is about oil, so it's traditional to eat fried goods such as potato latke pancakes or doughnuts.  Because the festival normally falls in December (although there are no guarantees with the Jewish lunisolar calendar), Hanukkah is often known as Jewish Christmas . While gift giving doesn't have any religious significance on Hanukkah, a tradition has developed to give presents during the festival - normally one for every night - possibly because of where it falls in the calendar. In 2017 the celebration begins on December 12 and ends on December 20.  Here are five facts you may not know about the festival: Unlike other major Jewish holidays, Hanukkah is not mentioned in the Hebrew Bible.   To commemorate the miracle of the burning lamp, Jews customarily eat foods fried in oil and this means doughnuts. ​ Chocolate coins or gelt (Yiddish for money) wrapped in gold and silver are exchanged at Hanukkah. Gelt is also used in a game played with a spinning top called a dreidel at Hanukkah. Players sit in a circle and put a chocolate coin in the middle. Each person takes a turn at spinning the cube-shaped dreidel, which has a Hebrew letter on each side. Traditionally Jews only exchanged gifts on Purim, a Jewish holiday commemorating the time when the Jewish people living in Persia were saved from extermination by a young woman called Esther. However, when Christmas became more prominent in the late 19th century and the Christian holiday’s consumerism grew, the Jewish custom shifted in imitation of Christmas.

" Referees' chief Mike Riley has revealed that Dean accepts he made a mistake in penalising Calum Chambers for a handball during Arsenal's 1-1 draw with West Brom  has admitted he made a mistake by awarding   a penalty in their New Year's Eve clash with  , according to referees' chief  . Dean and his team of officials were confronted by Arsenal boss   after Calum Chambers was penalised for a handball in the 88th minute of the 1-1 draw at The Hawthorns. Wenger was subsequently handed a three-match touchline ban and a £40,000 fine but, on the eve of the introduction of Video Assistant Referee (VAR) technology to English football, it has emerged that Dean has accepted he got the decision wrong. Wasn’t tested too much but produced a good stop with his feet to deny Alexandre Lacazette in the second half. Helpless for Arsenal’s goal. Had the beating of both Sead Kolasinac and Ainsley Maitland-Niles in the first half. Like the rest of his team, he faded after the break. Gave away the free-kick that led to Arsenal’s opener but he played really well otherwise. Marshalled Alexandre Lacazette well for the most part. Gave Alex Iwobi too much space in the first half and the Arsenal attacker should’ve scored. Was virtually faultless otherwise. Defended well and won a late penalty – albeit fortunately – when his cross struck Calum Chambers on the arm. Combative in the middle but his passing needs to improve. Mr Consistency. The Premier League’s most-capped player delivered another good performance here. The midfielder’s left foot is usually a wand but his final product wasn’t good enough today. Put himself about well and had a few good headed opportunities in the first half but couldn’t convert any of them. Converted a late penalty to earn West Brom a point. Ran his socks off. He and Rodriguez offered more as a partnership than Rondon has been doing in recent weeks. Looked like keeping his 200th Premier League clean sheet before Jay Rodriguez’s late penalty. Unlucky to concede a penalty for handball after a decent display. Dominated at the back for Arsenal and didn’t deserve to be on the losing side. A solid performance before he was replaced by Per Mertesacker late on. The wing-back got forward plenty but didn’t produce enough offensively. Always looking to make things happen when he got on the ball. His ability to change direction at speed is a real asset for Arsenal. Arsene Wenger clearly sees a lot in him but this was another ineffective performance. Matt Phillips exposed his immobility before injury forced Arsene Wenger to replace the wing-back. Started in place of the injured Mesut Ozil and was very poor before being replaced in the second half. Was heavily involved in most of Arsenal’s attacks and played a key role in their opening goal as his free-kick deflected beyond Ben Foster. Was quiet in the first half but produced a couple of real moments of quality after the break. Unlucky not to score. Riley feels VAR, which will be used for the first time in England on Monday night when Brighton & Hove Albion host Crystal Palace in the FA Cup and again on Wednesday for Arsenal's clash with Chelsea in the Carabao Cup semi-finals, would have helped overturn the decision. You award the penalty because what you have seen on the pitch is the arm coming towards the ball, Riley said, quoted by the  . What is handball can look to you on the field of play if you get one look at it. But immediately there is evidence from another camera angle which shows actually the opposite happened. That is the safety net of the VAR. I think Chambers would have been overturned. The question you ask is, is it an act of deliberate handball? And the reverse angle shows him trying to bring his arm out of the way of the ball, rather than the reverse. I know Mike would have overturned it. He messages people, and he's a very honest guy, and he goes, 'I got it wrong'. He knows he did. But Riley has expressed caution, warning VAR technology will not correct all of the injustices witnessed during matches. Riley is encouraged by its potential but believes a period of scepticism surrounding it is inevitable, and that even when system flaws have been eradicated, imperfections will remain part of the game. The referee of the Brighton v Palace game, Andre Marriner, will be remotely assisted on potentially game-changing decisions related to goals, penalties, straight red cards and cases of mistaken identity by Neil Swarbrick and Peter Kirkup. Attempts to minimise disruption to the game means Marriner's decisions can only be changed if a video review demonstrates he has made a clear error. Even then it is only if he requests assistance or it is recommended by the VAR, and Marriner makes the final decision. Players risk a booking if they attempt to influence any official to use VAR and managers or other non-playing club staff risk being sent to the stand if they do the same, or encroach on the area where the referee is reviewing footage. This will be really good for football, when we've worked through it, when we've ironed out all the subtleties in the protocol, said Riley, the managing director of Professional Game Match Officials Limited (PGMOL). It's going to take us time. You're actually asking a generation of referees to relearn or learn new processes and skills. It will never be 100 per cent (perfect) because it's so subjective on certain things and we're asking the clear and obvious question. We don't want errors. If through this we make that four per cent (of incorrect decisions made by select referees) two per cent, we've benefited the game. This is a starting point. You're balancing all the time: 'Let's not re-referee the game; let's keep the flow' versus 'Let's get the key situations right'.

" The Brazilian finally signed for Barcelona in a £142m deal over the weekend after months of protracted negotiations  has asked   fans to understand why he had to follow his dream and sign for  The Brazilian finally sealed a £142m move to the Nou Camp over the weekend after months of protracted negotiations and was presented as a Barca player in a lavish ceremony on Monday. The reaction back home to Coutinho's exit has been mixed with some supporters critical of the way the transfer eventually played out but the man himself has taken the time to post one last message to the Reds faithful and attempted to explain his decision. Coutinho joined Inter in 2008 from Vasco da Gama but was loaned back until 2010  Coutinho made 28 appearances and scored three goals before being loaned out to Espanyol  Coutinho was part of the Brazil team to win the under-20 World Cup in 2011  Liverpool signed Coutinho for £8m from Inter Liverpool FC via  Coutinho was handed the No 10 shirt at Anfield after being recommended by then-Inter boss Rafa Benitez Liverpool FC via  Coutinho scored his first goal against Swansea Liverpool FC via  Coutinho and Suarez became close friends at Liverpool - so much so that Suarez has already bought him a house in Barcelona ahead of his move  Coutinho made his first senior appearance against Iran before facing Mexico  Coutinho will be a third of one of the deadliest attacking triumvirate going to Russia this summer  His final Liverpool goal came against the same opponents as his first as the Reds beat Swansea 5-0  Coutinho's final Liverpool appearance in a Reds shirt came on 30 December against Leicester Liverpool FC via  Coutinho's transfer to Barcelona - the second most expensive ever - was announced on 6 January  Coutinho underwent a medical on 8 January ahead of his official unveiling later that day  Since the moment I arrived in Liverpool , me and my family have been made to feel so welcome and have made so many friends, he wrote on Instagram. On the pitch and off the pitch, we have experienced the beauty of this club and its fans. In turn, I hope I have delivered memories and moments that have brought happiness to the Liverpool supporters. Moving to Liverpool, I knew the club’s greatness and history but what I did learn during my time was the unique heart and soul of the place. It has its own personality and character. I leave Liverpool because Barcelona is a dream for me. Liverpool was a dream that I was fortunate enough to realise and I have given five years of my life to it. A career on the pitch only lasts for so long and to play for Barcelona as well as Liverpool is something I want to experience and enjoy while I am blessed enough to be able to do so. I hope the supporters understand that choosing to experience something new is not about diminishing their importance to me or the club’s importance. Nothing will ever diminish that in my heart. A post shared by   (@phil.coutinho) on  I wish Jürgen and the team nothing but joy and success for the rest of this season and beyond. This is an amazing team and they are getting better and better all the time. There are too many people I want to thank, but I cannot name everyone individually.

" Follow the latest from Coutinho's first press conference as a Barcelona player  was unveiled by Barcelona on Monday morning after the Spanish side completed an astounding £142m transfer for the Brazil international from  . The deal, which makes Coutinho the second-most expensive player in history behind £200m Paris Saint-Germain forward Neymar, was completed late last week, with the attacking midfielder travelling to Barcelona over the weekend to complete the deal. The 25-year-old underwent a medical this morning, and will sign his new five-and-a-half-year contract that will be worth around £250,000-a-week, with a buy-out clause of €400m [£355m]. It appears it's going to take some time for Coutinho to make his way up for his unveiling, but fear not, we'll keep you updated on all the latest developments including what the player himself has to say.

" The 24-year-old finally completed his move to the Blues but Mayor Joe Anderson wants the transfer scrutinised  Liverpool mayor Joe Anderson has called for an FA investigation into  's £15m move from Everton to Chelsea. In a Twitter outburst, the 59-year-old elected official claimed the deal needs looking into from football's governing body after the transfer price dropped by £20m from a potential move last summer. Barkley had undertaken a medial at Chelsea's Cobham training ground back in August ahead of a £35m move before the plug was pulled at the final hour and after not playing a minute since due to injury he  . After a failed deadline day move to Manchester City in the summer, the Chilean forward has refused to sign a contract with the London-based club, and will have a host of top European sides after him in January or the summer.  The German playmaker’s protracted contract negotiations are well documented, and he will have a host of suitors should he fail to resign for the Gunners before the summer. Arsenal FC via  The United playmaker is yet to renew his contract with the club, however having started 13 games this season, it seems unlikely the Spaniard will be shown the door by Mourinho.  Following strong criticism from his own manager and pundits, after a series of long-term injuries, the former-Saint looks set to leave Old Trafford after four seasons that has seen him make only 53 appearances for United. Man Utd via  Manchester United have a one-year option they can invoke in the Spaniard’s contract should they wish to extend his stay at Old Trafford. Nemanja Matic’s arrival has limited the midfielder’s opportunities with the majority of his appearances this season coming from the bench. Man Utd via  Having struggled with injuries for years the Arsenal academy graduate has played in Arsenal’s previous four games. Undoubtedly talented, should the midfielder reject a proposed contract extension from the London club he will have plenty of Premier League sides eager to sign him at the end of the season. Arsenal FC via  Heavily linked with a move to Juventus, the former-Bayern Munich midfielder has been frustrated by Jurgen Klopp’s rotation policy in a congested Liverpool midfield, and with the impending arrival of Naby Keita from Leipzig in the summer, sees his opportunities further diminishing. Liverpool FC via  Struggling for game time in a United midfield consisting of Paul Pogba, Ander Herrera, and Nemanja Matic, the Belgian may be tempted to move in search of first team opportunities.  The Champions League winner, now 34, has struggled with injury this season, and has understandably looked rusty upon his return to the Bayern starting eleven. Bongarts/ While the midfielder is out of contract next summer, it is believed that Guardiola is keen for the City hierarchy to offer the 32-year-old Brazilian a new contract.  Having made only 13 appearances for Mourinho’s side in all competitions this season, the versatile Dutchman has been linked with a move to Barcelona.  Following his conversion to full-back by manager Jose Mourinho, the 32-year-old has scored twice and provided four assists with his dangerous delivery from out wide. Teams in the Premier League will be keen to secure the former Aston Villa player’s experience next term. Man Utd via  At 33 the Italian centre-back is still a world-class player, and with less than a year on his contract, will surely be a bargain for whoever secures his services next summer.  Undoubted class, but at 36, whether the Swede represents value for money is another matter, with the striker one of the highest paid players in the Premier League.  The former Liverpool striker has had to settle for a place on the bench since his return to Atletico Madrid, behind Antoine Griezmann and Kevin Gameiro in the pecking order. A move away surely beckons for the 33-year-old.  Former-Spurs flyer Lennon has not been offered a new contract by current club Everton, but will certainly add Premier League know-how to promoted sides looking to avoid relegation next season.  Bayern’s other veteran winger has also had an injury-stricken season in Bavaria, though has still managed to score three and assist four in all competitions. The Dutchman is certainly still a threat when fully fit. Bongarts/ Having won the Champions League three times, Casillas is certainly a high-quality goalkeeper. Could the Spanish veteran be a good signing for a top-European club?  Blighted by serious injuries to his Achilles and having had surgery nine times in 14 months, the diminutive midfielder will hope to regain his fitness to restart his career. Arsenal FC via  The pacey winger has enjoyed a four year spell in Ukraine with Shakhtar Donetsk, though in not signing a new contract, may have his heart set on playing in one of Europe’s top five leagues.  The enigmatic Italian striker has reignited his stop-start career in Nice with 33 goals in 49 appearances for the French side.  Talent in abundance though lacking work rate, teams interested in the attacker will hope they can see the player find the form he displayed at OGC Nice, scoring 18 goals and assisting 7 in 2015/16.  The stocky Argentine forward has been on fire this season in the Chinese Super League, scoring 20 goals and assisting 19 in 27 games. A return to Europe is surely on the cards for the former-Napoli man.  Displaced from the Everton starting line-up by £30m summer arrival Jordan Pickford, the Spaniard will be eager to guarantee himself more game-time should next year.  The Atletico Madrid legend, now 32, is under increasing competition from Croatian full-back Sime Vrsaljko and could be tempted by a move before retirement.  The Ajax forward, currently sidelined with a serious knee injury, had an excellent season in 2016/17 and was rewarded with his first Germany cap by Joachim Lowe in June this year.  The French target-man has enjoyed the most prolific spell of his career with Mexican side Tigres UANL, scoring a goal in every two games in all competitions. Proven in Ligue 1 with Marseille, the striker is capable of succeeding in Europe.  Capable of dictating games at the top-level, the Frenchman could surely be a wildcard for a top side in the Premier League next season.  Winner of Ligue 1 with AS Monaco last year, the 31-year-old midfielder is into the final year of his contract.  The box-to-box midfielder has had an excellent start to the season, scoring 4 goals from central midfield for Schalke. The German international has been linked with moves to top European sides Barcelona and Juventus. Bongarts/ The Mexican wideman has found goals hard to come by this season, scoring just once this season for Real Sociedad.  After years of speculation that Toure would leave Manchester City, the Ivorian’s time at City finally seems to coming to an end.  Liverpool have been linked to the Netherland’s international in recent weeks as Jurgen Klopp seeks to add quality to his defence.  The Bundesliga winner has made only four appearances this season, often failing to even make the bench for Dortmund.  The 22-year-old playmaker Meyer has been consistently linked with Liverpool, Tottenham and Barcelona and has so far refused any contract offers made by Schalke. Bongarts/ The Spanish midfielder has been a mainstay for SD Eibar over the past three seasons. Offering a goal-threat from midfield with his long-distance shooting and set-piece ability, Garcia could prove a shrewd acquisition.  The Moroccan full back has deputised well for Dani Carvajal in La Liga this season, and has shown glimpses of his potential at the Bernabeu.  Disappointing performances for the Bianconeri this season, and added competition from Mattia de Sciglio have led to rumours that the Swiss defender could be set to leave Turin in January.  The 25-year-old defender has guided FC Porto to the top of the Primeira Liga, conceding only six goals in the process.  Still only 20, the Turkish forward has seen his career stall since moving to Spain from Manchester City. Should the striker fail to sign a new contract with Villareal, a move back to the Eredivisie could prove fruitful for a striker with vast potential.  The experienced Brazilian right-back is entering the last year of his contract with Bayern Munich. Capable of deputising at the top level, and with invaluable experience in the Champions league, the 32-year old could provide excellent cover for an elite European side next season. Bongarts/ The Porto centre-back, also capable of playing left-back, has been the subject of interest from Everton following a number of impressive displays for the Iberian club.  Former Atletico Madrid star Miranda has started all but one league game for Inter Milan this term helping his side keep eight clean sheets so far. Should he fail to renew his contract with the Nerazzuri, he will be a top acquisition for any side.  The 23-year-old goalkeeper is yet to sign a new deal with Athletic Bilbao, and is rumoured to be close to agreeing a move to Real Madrid for €20m.  The five-time Serie A winner is capable of playing in a variety of positions and would certainly be a valuable squad player for top sides in Europe.  The 26-year-old striker has been in excellent form for Hoffenheim this season, scoring 12 goals in all competitions. Bongarts/ Injured since the summer, the experienced right winger would be a gamble with such little game time in the past year. If he can prove his fitness, the winger is capable of creating chances from wide areas, with six assists last season in La Liga.  The Spanish playmaker is yet to agree a new contract and has proven, when fit, that he is capable of playing at the top level.  The Werder Bremen creative midfielder has assisted 49 in 182 appearances, scoring 20 goals in the process. Bongarts/ It was enough to prompt Anderson - a lifelong Toffees fan - to question the deal. He tweeted: “I will be writing to the Premier League and the FA calling for investigation into the circumstances around the transfer of Ross Barkley between Everton and Chelsea. Agent pulls transfer on deadline day of £35 million doesn’t play again transfer for months later £20 million We also got a good deal in a transfer fee that was honest, everyone knows Barkley is worth at least £50 million in today’s market, don’t mind him going but club and fans being ripped off. Responding to a Twitter user who pointed out Barkley's contract at Everton was up in the summer, Anderson added: Wake up smell the coffee, last summer four months ago EFC accepted a bid from Chelsea for £35 million the deal was pulled by Barkley and agent. Chelsea is only Barkley's second permanent club having joined Everton as an 11-year-old and worked his way up through the ranks, making his debut as a 17-year-old and going on to make 179 appearances for the club. But a move away from his boyhood club has been on the cards for a while after struggling for game time at Goodison Park and fell out with the hierarchy. Mayor Anderson was left seething by the transfer fee for a player Everton had developed, adding: Both Lukaku and Stones not homegrown talent left Everton and we got a great price, Barkley home grown player has left and has cost Everton £20 million at least. There is no defence for me of him,he could have signed a longer contract and still left the club. Barkley appeared relieved to be leaving Everton and at his Chelsea unveiling said: To be given a fresh start at a new club like Chelsea, it’s unbelievable for me. The FA are yet to respond to Anderson's tweets. We use cookies to enhance your visit to our site and to bring you advertisements that might interest you. Read our   and   Policies to find out more.

" One says Government should 'give them a chance' and another warned 'otherwise they are gonna find another extremist group and join them' Young British Muslims think   returning from Syria should be reintegrated into society and rehabilitated rather than being sent to prison, a study suggests. The national study found young British Muslims across the UK believe returnee fighters should be reintegrated into society, with one saying the Government should “give them a chance” and another warning that “otherwise they are gonna find another extremist group and join them”. Dr Imran Awan, Associate Professor of Criminology at Birmingham City University, told  he was surprised so many were pro-rehabilitation, “because many young Muslim voices are never heard within the discourse on terrorism”. Dr Awan interviewed with 25 male and 25 female British Muslims, aged between 14 and 25, from areas of the UK where there is a record of people travelling to Syria and joining Isis, to collect their views on why they think young Muslims travel to fight for jihadi groups, and what they think should happen when they return.  : “When people feel isolated and angry because they are not being treated with respect and if they go out and fight in Syria and when they come back there is no help, then I promise you, you will see more terrorism because these young people will think why should I do anything when my own Government don’t care about me.” As many as 800 Britons are estimated to have travelled to fight for or support jihadi groups in Syria or Iraq, and around half are feared to have returned to the UK.  Last year, the Government admitted just 14 of nearly 400 returnee fighters have been jailed, raising fears the rest are living off the radar and may be vulnerable to radicalisation.  The Home Office told   the number of returnee fighters who have been convicted are not routinely published. The Government's current strategy for returnee fighters is to convict and imprison those they can prove have committed a crime and refer the rest to the Channel deradicalisation programme.  Adam Deen, Executive Director of anti-extremism think-tank Quilliam UK, warned returnee fighters must be referred to Channel and monitored in case they are planning to form a terror cell or conduct an attack. “What is important here is that the more Isis are under siege and the more territory they're losing, the more they're going to channel their efforts and energies into terrorism,” he said in an interview with  .  “Those individuals that have managed to get back into the country will be activated or will be conspiring to commit some kind of terrorist act. That's a major concern.” Mr Deen added: “The likelihood of someone committing a terrorist attack who has gone abroad and has joined Isis is very high.” Fighters of the Islamic State wave the group's flag from a damaged display of a government fighter jet following the battle for the Tabqa air base, in Raqqa, Syria AP Fighters from Islamic State group sit on their tank during a parade in Raqqa, Syria AP Fighters from the Islamic State group pray at the Tabqa air base after capturing it from the Syrian government in Raqqa, Syria AP Fighters from extremist Islamic State group parade in Raqqa, Syria AP A video uploaded to social networks shows men in underwear being marched barefoot along a desert road before being allegedly executed by Isis   Haruna Yukawa after his capture by Isis Khalinda Sharaf Ajour, a Yazidi, says two of her daughters were captured by Isis militants   Washington Post Spokesperson for Isis Vice News via Youtube A pro-Isis leaflet handed out on Oxford Street In London Ghaffar Hussain Isis Jihadists burn their passports A man collecting aid administered by Isis in Syria A woman collecting aid administered by Isis in Syria Local civilians queue for aid administered by Isis.

Churches remain unharmed and street cleaners are back at work Channel was set up following the 7/7 attacks to identify those vulnerable to radical ideology and turn them away from the path to extremism. The voluntary programme uses a network of mentors, psychologists and trained imams to counsel and guide those at risk. Mr Deen said the programme was “very effective” for those who engage with the programme, leading individuals to disavow their extremist beliefs. However, he said it was “a question of them agreeing to it in the first place”. “The problem here is that it's voluntary. It can't be enforced.” Little research has been conducted to assess the results of the Channel programme, and Mr Deen said there is a lack of transparency around the number of people referred and whether they were successfully turned away from extremism. Critics have said the programme threatens to alienate Muslims, with rights groups warning it could have the averse affect of driving people towards extremism. Dr Awan said rehabilitation programmes in Denmark had been “successful in terms of policing and making sure returnee fighters are looking for jobs and contributing towards society,” and suggested returnee fighters could “provide a powerful counter narrative” to dissuade people from going to fight for Isis. He said his study had come at a “crucial time” following the  , when attempts are being made to understand why 52-year-old Muslim-convert Khalid Masood ploughed a rented car through crowds of pedestrians on Westminster Bridge before fatally stabbing a police officer outside the Houses of Parliament. He said: “Quite often questions are posed about why someone would do that, about what leads somebody down that pathway. My report shows what in effect a lot of young Muslims think is happening.” The interviewees referred to several push and pull factors for why young Muslims might become radicalised and travel to fight for Isis, ranging from boredom to issues with lack of identity and concerns over foreign policy. The majority thought social media and the internet play a key role in radicalisation, with one warning “all they do is go online and some preacher then tells them to come and fight for Islam”. When Isis declared their “caliphate” three years ago, their fighters openly used Twitter to urge Muslims to travel to Syria and Iraq and shared gory and extreme videos. “If people are watching these videos online then they are going to be radicalised because Isis are using the Internet to shout out to them that we [Muslims] are being oppressed,” one 16-year-old said. Another, 15, warned: “A lot of my friends are on Facebook and a lot of them are watching stuff online that are extreme.” Others suggested young Muslims may travel to fight in Syria simply because they are bored or looking for an adrenaline rush. One said: “They want some excitement in their lives and are pushing those boundaries,” while another suggested “what we are seeing really is just some young frustrated teenagers who are looking for an escape”. Many spoke about how young Muslims in the UK were “confused” and searching for an identity, which Dr Awan said allowed Isis to use a powerful marketing brand to create an identity to attract young recruits. “Some said well actually what do you expect, they're isolated, they're angry, they don't have a sense of identity, he said. Interviewees told him Isis push out messages of unity and brotherhood around their idea of a global caliphate which can be attractive to those who are looking for a sense of belonging. One 16-year-old interviewee told him: “Some of these people don’t have anywhere where they believe is home. So they think yes let’s jump to these guys [Isis] because they are bringing me to a global brotherhood.” However, concerns over foreign policy were also thought to be a key part of why young British Muslims were travelling to fight in Syria.  “For me, it’s all about foreign policy,” a 16-year-old interviewee said. “I actually know some of the boys that went from here and they were always talking about the problems in Palestine and the fact our government never helps them.” Dr Awan said: “A lot of them kept saying they were watching YouTube clips of Syrians being murdered and killed. Isis tends to play on these types of anger.” Dr Awan said he hoped his study would encourage the Government and police to reengage with young British Muslims to understand their concerns. He also said his research “sheds light on what is often a heated debate” about what British Muslims really think about terrorism.

" A surprising slide in the rankings to 28th meant former world number two Radwanska entered this week as an unseeded player, but she showed her quality in a 6-3 7-5 victory  saw her Sydney International title defence swiftly ended as she lost to Agnieszka Radwanska in the first round. A surprising slide in the rankings to 28th meant former world number two Radwanska entered this week as an unseeded player, but she showed her quality in a 6-3 7-5 victory over British hope Konta. In a repeat of last year's final match-up, this time fourth seed Konta could not take control of the contest against Poland's former Wimbledon runner-up. Consolation for Konta came with the fact she completed the match without obvious physical problems, five days after being forced to retire from her Brisbane International quarter-final with Elina Svitolina due to injury. She now heads for Melbourne and the Australian Open, where 12 months ago she reached the quarter-finals, while Radwanska stays in Sydney and faces American teenager CiCi Bellis next. Radwanska said of her win, according to wtatennis.com: I'm just so happy to play such a great match before the Australian Open. It was a top-10 level match with some ups and downs, breaks along the way. The conditions weren't easy, but I'm happy to win in two sets. Slovakian Dominika Cibulkova won a second-round contest against Russian Elena Vesnina to reach the quarter-finals, coming through a 6-4 6-4 victor, with Czech Barbora Strycova and Australian Samantha Stosur also posting wins on Tuesday.

" For the second game running the British number one fought back from losing the first set, eventually triumphing 4-6 6-1 6-4  expressed her delight at coming through yet another gruelling three-set epic after she saw off   to reach the quarter-finals of the  . Konta was forced to rally from a set down for the second time in two days as she battled back to beat a spirited Tomljanovic, eventually prevailing 4-6 6-1 6-4. Britain’s number one arrived in Brisbane on the back of a miserable run of form that had seen her fail to win a match since August. But she has started 2018 promisingly having teamed up with a new coach, Michael Joyce, at the beginning of December. “To be honest, it's a great thing to have two tough matches early on,” Konta said on-court after the match. “It's a boost, the match fitness, and it boosts a lot of the competitive scenarios that we're going to face the whole year. I'm sure my next match will be the same.” Konta appeared to be feeling the effects of Monday’s battle against   at the start of her second round match and Tomljanovic was able to break her serve no fewer than four times in the opening set. The 24-year-old Croatian, currently ranked 118th in the world, was able to take the first set when she held for just the second time in the match herself, but struggled to match Konta’s firepower in the second.

But she held her nerve in the clutch to win in two hours and 26-minutes. “It was a tough match - Ajla came out playing well, especially in that first set, and it took me a little bit of time to find my rhythm,” Konta said. “She made that very difficult, so that's a credit to her and she played incredibly freely at the end of the third set. There wasn't a lot in it so I'm very happy to have just stayed tough and just come through that.” Tomljanovic, who had her boyfriend   watching in the stands, meanwhile added that she was pleased with her performance. “I thought I played my first round really well. I was probably a little more nervous for that one just because it was the first one,” she said. “Coming up today, I expected to play well because I've been training well. I've had good wins over the last couple of months, going deep into tournaments, even though they're not the same level like here. “I've got nothing to be sad about. I'm disappointed just because I obviously wanted to win, and I love playing here. Looking ahead, I'm just pleased with where my game is going, and just hopefully I stay as healthy as possible.” Konta will now play either Ana Konjuh or third-seed   for a place in the semi-finals of the tournament.

" Bo Scarbrough denies shouting 'F*** Trump' on his way to the pitch despite video footage suggesting otherwise Alabama running back   has been accused of shouting “F*** Trump” before Monday night’s College Playoff National Championship game against Georgia, with the President of the United States also facing a backlash over his failure to sing the entire national anthem. Protesters also projected the same phrase onto the Mercedes-Benz Stadium ahead of  ’s arrival at the ground, while fans were seen waving towels emblazoned with the same message on them. Upon his arrival, a section of fans booed Mr Trump, although others applauded him. Mr Trump has heavily criticised National Football League players who have protested during the national anthem with the ‘Take a Knee’ campaign over the last year regarding racial inequality and the mistreatment of black people by law enforcement. But Mr Trump faced criticism after he failed to sing all of the words during the national anthem ahead of Monday night’s in Atlanta. That wasn’t the only controversy to stem from the match, as footage taken from a camera phone appeared to reveal Scarbrough shouting an obscenity about the President ahead of the match. Scarbrough has taken to social media to reject the accusations, and he wrote on Twitter that he had shouted the word “Georgia” instead of “Trump”, despite the footage appearing to suggest otherwise. “If y’all really listen I said Georgia,” Scarbrough said. “Smh [shake my head] about y’all people in this world.” If y’all really listen I said Georgia smh about y’all people in this world  Neither Alabama nor Georgia were on the pitch for the playing of the Star-Spangled Banner as they left the changing rooms shortly after the national anthem, but the incident involving Scarbrough appears to have taken place as Alabama made their way through the stadium ahead of kick-off – shortly after the controversy surrounding Mr Trump’s singing took place. In the original video, which was taken by Sporting News, Scarbrough – wearing the No 9 jersey – can be seen walking with his teammates and shouting as he approaches the camera. Alabama RB Bo Scarbrough yells “F— Trump” before tonight’s title game.  A number of Scarbrough’s Twitter followers refused to believe his explanation and criticised him for allegedly shouting the expletive, with responses showing a mixture of people who supporter Mr Trump and those who did not, but felt that the running back had reduced himself to the President’s level. The controversy adds to the protests against Mr Trump, which come just days after the President’s extraordinary social media outburst in which he defended himself against accusations against his mental health and claiming that he is a “very stable genius”. Yes, he got bood and this was posted all around the stadium along with towels the crowd waved saying Fuck Trump! notice the crowd wasn’t shown😛that’s why my friend!  Mr Trump could also attend matches in the NFL play-offs this month ahead of the Super Bowl, with the New England Patriots’ owner Robert Kraft a close ally of his, with the Patriots tipped to reach the NFL’s showcase match for a second consecutive year.

"   Oxford University has been accused of 'institutional bias' following figures obtained from a Freedom of Information Act request by the Guardian. The report showed that, on average, white applicants are up
to twice as likely to be offered a place as their ethnic minority equivalent,
despite having earned the same grades at A-level. Applications to the
university in 2010 and 2011 revealed that 25.7 per cent of white applicants received an
offer for a place at the university, compared to only 17.2 per cent of students from
ethnic minorities. Oxford University has excused previous claims stating that
ethnic minority applicants are more likely to apply for competitive courses,
such as medicine. However the figures reveal that, while medicine is a highly
sought after and prestigious course, white applicants were twice as likely to
gain a place over ethnic minority candidates even when the same triple A*
grades had been achieved. The figures also revealed no 'statiscally significant
difference' for the course of law between white and ethnic minority students.
However, for their economics and management course-the university’s most
competitive-19.1 per cent of white applicants received offers, compared with 9.3 per cent for
those from ethnic minority backgrounds. Previous data obtained by David Lammy MP made the headlines in 2010
when it was revealed that just one British black Caribbean undergraduate was
admitted to Oxford in 2009. Oxford’s explanation of this was due to the
prevalence of black and minority ethnic (BME) candidates applying to the most
competitive courses, Lammy said. “This new evidence blows that apart. We now know BME
students get fewer offers even with the same grades. Where there are interviews
and quite large hurdles at the application stage, as with Oxbridge, it is for
the universities to demonstrate there is not institutional bias. There figures
suggest institutional bias, and certainly show sustained institutional
failure.” An Oxford university spokeswoman said: “Oxford University is
committed to selecting the very best students, regardless of race, ethnicity,
or any other factor. This is not only the right thing to do but it is in our
own interests. Differences in success rates between ethnic groups are therefore
something we are continuing to examine carefully for possible explanations. We
do know that a tendency by students from certain ethnic groups to apply
disproportionately for the most competitive subjects reduces the success rate
of those ethnic groups overall. However, we have never claimed this was the
only factor in success rate disparities between students with similar exam
grades. “We do not know students’ A-level grades when selecting, as
they have not yet taken their exams. Aptitude tests, GCSEs and interviews,
which are used in our selection process, have not been explored in this
analysis and are important in reaching reliable conclusions.” Vice-president of higher education at the National Union of
Students, Rachel Wenstone, said: “My initial response to these figures was
shock-this is quite frightening, and the university
needs to deal with it immediately.” We use cookies to enhance your visit to our site and to bring you advertisements that might interest you. Read our   and   Policies to find out more.

" Where to stay in Unesco's newly minted World Heritage Site Unesco just confirmed it: the Lake District is a place you need to visit. The   offers extraordinary landscapes, fantastic walks, peerless views  - and some fantastic hotels to go with it all. It’s more accessible than you think, too, with trains from London Euston to Oxenholme taking under three hours, and the journey from Glasgow taking just 105 minutes. The hotel scene hasn’t always been the best up here, but today, following renovations and new openings, there’s something for everyone. From family-friendly, pet-friendly, luxury to budget, here are 10 of the best. In a prime location overlooking Lake Windermere, it’s hard to compete with the view here. Nevertheless, the Belsfield tries – acquired by Laura Ashley in 2014, the 62 rooms are impeccably furnished, and there’s a fine dining restaurant and a swimming pool too. A five-minute walk from the hub of Bowness-on-Windermere, it is particularly ideal for a first visit to The Lakes. The Gilpin has a reputation as a couples and ‘mini-mooners’ hotel – little surprise when the rates are sky high. The hotel is spread across the lodge, which has 25 rooms, and the Lake House which once belonged to the owner’s grandmother and houses the higher category rooms. A standout feature is the ‘spa trail’ – a three-hour couples-tastic experience including private use of a pool, a hot tub and time in the ‘snug’ (essentially a summer house) with afternoon tea.  Overlooking the water in the village of Newby Bridge at the south of Lake Windermere, the Swan’s rooms cater to every type of customer. The ‘cosy’ rooms are fairly affordable, but there are also luxurious loft suites, two-room family suites and even a £400-per-night studio named “The Love Nest”, complete with double walk-in rainfall shower. There’s an ESPA spa, gym, and even a marina to moor the boat that you’re obviously bringing. Recently redeveloped, the Samling sits on 67 acres of land – with just 11 bedrooms to share it. You’ll pay through the nose for that privacy, though – rates hover around the £500 mark. But for that, you get access to things like a hot tub overlooking Lake Windermere and a Michelin-starred restaurant on site.  A 12-room B&B that’s a 15-minute walk away from the village of Bowness, Hawksmoor is an affordable choice for the Lakes. Rooms are modern (think statement wallpaper), and perks include free fishing and use of the highly rated spa at a nearby hotel. The award-winning breakfast is not to be sniffed at.  Another Bowness hotel, the Cranleigh’s 18 rooms are all decorated individually, but overall they’re contemporary if not outré. Like mirrored walls, peekaboo bathtubs and leopard-print? You’ll be in your element. Very un-Lakes-like, but appealing for that very reason. In a small village near Ambleside, the Langdale mixes up its rooms with one, two and three-bed lodges. The look is contemporary – rooms range from clean-and-simple to statement wallpaper and nickel bathtubs by the bed, while the lodges are scattered around the 35-acre estate. Facilities include a 21m pool and tennis court.  A four-star hotel at the tip of Bassenthwaite, in the north of the Lake District, Armathwaite is an old country pile surrounded by 400 acres of secluded deer park. Décor’s fairly traditional, in line with the castle-like exterior, but the dark wood furniture is pepped up with pattered sofas, colourful cushions and the odd statement wallpaper.  Sitting on the shore of Lake Windermere, the Macdonald is one of the most iconic hotels in the Lakes. It’s one of the bigger properties around, with a whopping 106 rooms, but the views make up for it – even the Lakehouse restaurant has panoramic views.  This family-run hotel in Ambleside has been going strong for 37 years, but that’s not to say it’s old-school. Even the entry-level rooms have natty colour palettes, sharp-patterned curtains and blown-up photos of the lakes behind the beds, while the nautical-themed Sail Loft has a private terrace overlooking the village.  We use cookies to enhance your visit to our site and to bring you advertisements that might interest you.

" Being chauffer-driven down to the “Lake House” of the Gilpin Hotel in a royal family-esque Land Rover is as clear message as any that this is not your average Lake District hotel.  The family-run Gilpin is totally secluded, up in the hills of Cumbria, yet is actually only a five-minute drive away from the most popular, biggest and busiest lake; Windermere. It used to be a standalone hotel, but in 2010, the Lake House was converted into accommodation about a mile and a half from the main lodge – hence the Land Rover.  The hotel has 25 rooms in the main lodge, six in the Lake House and four separate “spa lodges”. All are individually designed and many are requested by the same regulars time and time again – the general manager tells me one couple even marked their 100th visit to the hotel recently. What keeps them coming back? The spa, for starters. In 2013 it introduced a “spa trail”, a three-hour course which involves designing your own scent for an hour-long aromatherapy massage, a cream tea in the snug (essentially a small summerhouse overlooking the lake), private use of the pool and sauna before enjoying champagne in an outdoor jacuzzi in front of the lake (from £100pp).  There’s a homely feel in the communal areas of the lodge where comfy, plush sofas line the lounge along with an array of books and newspapers for guests to get stuck into and put their feet up. The main restaurant, Michelin-starred Hrishi, is split into two dining rooms rather than one main industrial-style restaurant. The other, Gilpin Spice, is a pan-Asian restaurant serving dishes like the Indian street food pan puri and Malaysian laksa.  Many find Lake Windermere overrated (too busy, full of tourists) while others obsess over its beauty. The great thing about the Gilpin, though, is that its location is a plus for both camps. Windermere is a five-minute drive or half-hour walk from the hotel; those after total seclusion (and a lake of their own) can stay at home. There’s a very clear feel the lodge is designed to feel as homely as possible; each classic (entry-level) room could pass as a bedroom in somebody’s house. Next there are master rooms, junior suites and garden suites, the latter with doors leading to a private garden complete with hot tub. The Lake House has just six rooms and, true to its name, its very own private lake. Most of the rooms overlook the water (you can take a rowing boat out on it, if you want), and the one I stayed in – “Harriet”, named after the owner’s grandmother – had possibly the comfiest king-size bed I have ever slept in.  Finally, for those wanting to push the boat out, there are four luxury spa lodges which opened in 2016 – as well as a hot tub, each have an outdoor sauna – both of which look out onto the moors of Cumbria.

" ‘We will have a second safety-trained person on every train except in exceptional circumstances’ — Mick Whelan, ASLEF Drivers working for Southern Railways have voted by four-to-one to end the long-running   over staffing and working practices.  The row over who should open and close the doors on trains has disrupted services sporadically for almost two years.  The agreement between the train drivers’ union, ASLEF, and Southern’s parent company, Govia Thameslink Railway (GTR), was approved by 79 per cent to 21 per cent, with a turn-out of 87 per cent.  In February, the drivers rejected a   brokered by the TUC general secretary, Frances O’Grady. Nick Brown, chief operating officer for Govia Thameslink Railway, said: “This dispute has been difficult for our passengers in particular and we are pleased that we can now move ahead and deliver stability. “Should, in certain circumstances, a train not have that second person on board then it will still be able to run until a replacement can be provided. “Driver-only operation has been operating safely for 32 years and now accounts for over a third of the UK rail network.” Mick Whelan, ASLEF’s general secretary, said: “The agreement means we will have a second safety-trained person on every train covered by this agreement except in exceptional circumstances. That person will have all the relevant safety competence – including the skills to evacuate passengers in an emergency. “We now look forward to working with Southern Rail to restore good industrial relations and deliver the service passengers in the region deserve.” But he said the settlement does not have implications for other train operators: “This deal is a resolution to an 18 month long dispute. It is not a template for Britain’s railway in the 21st century.” The vote sets ASLEF apart from the other big rail union, the RMT, whose members are on strike today over driver-only operation. Paul Plummer, chief executive of the Rail Delivery Group, representing train operators, said: “This decision leaves the RMT leadership completely isolated. The travelling public will not thank them for another round of disruptive and unnecessary strike action.”  Members of the RMT have stopped work on Southern, South Western Railway, Greater Anglia, Northern and Merseyrail. The union’s general secretary, Mick Cash, said: “These strikes are about rail safety and accessibility pure and simple.” The dispute has spread to South Western Railway because the RMT is seeking assurances about working practices when a new fleet of suburban trains are introduced in 2019.  At Britain’s busiest station, London Waterloo, “contingency guards” working for the train operator were operating some trains. No trains are running on the lines west of Poole and Yeovil Junction, nor on the Isle of Wight.  The action will continue tomorrow on both South Western and Southern.  In the Northern region, the train operator is seeking to run two-thirds of the normal weekday timetable. Most services will finish by 7pm. The Labour MP for Salford and Eccles, Rebecca Long-Bailey, has weighed in by  : “Solidarity with RMT workers in Manchester today raising serious safety concerns of driver only trains.” The Office of Rail and Road has  of driver-only operation: “Our inspectors are satisfied that with suitable equipment, proper procedures and competent staff in place, it is a safe method of working.” We use cookies to enhance your visit to our site and to bring you advertisements that might interest you.

" As RMT members stop work on five big train operators, the union demands meeting with new transport secretary – then finds Chris Grayling still has the job   After staring hopefully at the departure boards at London Waterloo for 40 minutes, rush-hour commuter Louise Lenarduzzi recommended a plan to end the bitter series of rail strikes: “Lock them all in a room and hopefully they can come to a solution as quickly as possible.” Members of the RMT union working for South Western Railway, Northern, Merseyrail and Greater Anglia are striking on Monday, Wednesday and Friday this week over  . In addition, staff working for Southern – where the dispute began – took action on Monday.  South Western Railway, which runs to and from Britain’s busiest station, London Waterloo, told commuters: “We will once again be utilising the goodwill of our team of contingency guards to keep you moving and expect to run over 70 per cent of our normal Monday to Friday service. Northern was aiming to run over 60 per cent of its trains, but only between 7am and 7pm. Merseyrail operated during the same time window, though it said: “There will be no trains running on the Kirkby, Ellesmere Port or Hunts Cross lines during the strike action.” “By running longer trains we will provide an even higher percentage of seats. The majority of routes will see a reduced service, with buses replacing trains on a small number of routes.” Greater Anglia said it was operating all of its services.  The RMT says the dispute over driver-only operation of doors “from day one has been about the guarantee of the second safety critical person on the train for safety, security and accessibility reasons”. But the rail industry insists that trains on which drivers control the doors have been carrying passengers safely for three decades. The   infiltrated the bitter, long-running rail dispute. The Conservatives’ official Twitter account announced at 11.43am that transport secretary Chris Grayling would become party chairman.  The RMT then issued an immediate   calling for an “urgent meeting” with the new transport secretary, saying the replacement of Mr Grayling “opens up an opportunity for a new approach”.  In the release Mick Cash, the general secretary, said: “RMT is ready to brief the new transport secretary on the deals that we have struck in Scotland and Wales that secure the guarantee of a guard and which underpin the principles of passenger safety, security and access on our trains. “With the action on this week this is the most pressing issue facing Chris Grayling’s replacement and there should be no delay in getting talks moving.” However, the Conservatives’ Tweet announcing Mr Grayling’s appointment as party chairman was subsequently deleted.

The research compares the average amount of floor space £100 per month buys in rental homes in every inner London postcode. Unsurprisingly, space is tighter and budgets go least far in London out of everywhere in the country. Renters will find the best value in  , SE2, where £100 a month gets you 5.86sq m of floor space – an area slightly larger than a ping pong table – says letting agent  , who compiled the data. In comparison, the same budget will get renters almost three times (14.83sq m) the amount of floor space in  , the most affordable UK city for lettings. Also in south-east London,  , SE19, was the second best value for money area in the capital with 5.53sq m for £100 a month.  , SE18 and Selhurst, SE25 were also in the top five areas for amount of space per £100. The only area in the top five outside south-east London was  , NW4, which came in at third place with £100 a month getting 5.36sq m of floor space. The London areas where renters get least space for their money are all in central London, with the City of London, EC4, scoring worst, with only 1.27sq m of floor space on offer. Chelsea, the West End, Mayfair and Marylebone and Bloomsbury all offered less than 2.5sq m for £100 per month. Even the worst UK city after London – Oxford – offers 5.03sq m per £100, putting it in equal 13  place with Leyton, E10, on the London list. “London scores so badly in this metric because of its huge rental prices, but also because of the common practice of subdividing larger, older properties into several smaller properties, designed to be able to accommodate more and more renters, “ said Sam Hurst, of OpenRent. “To solve the issue, the city needs thousands more homes built directly for the private rented sector, and to ease the numbers of people entering the rental market by making new and first-time homes more affordable to buy.” Follow us on Twitter  ,   and "
